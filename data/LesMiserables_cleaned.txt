e address marius turned pale all the blood flowed back to his heart what address the address that you asked me to get she added as though with an effort the address you know very well yes stammered marius of that young lady this word uttered she sighed deeply marius sprang from the parapet on which he had been sitting and seized her hand distractedly oh well lead me thither tell me ask of me anything you wish where is it come with me she responded i don t know the street or number very well it is in quite the other direction from here but i know the house well i will take you to it she withdrew her hand and went on in a tone which could have rent the heart of an observer but which did not even graze marius in his intoxicated and ecstatic state oh how glad you are a cloud swept across marius brow he seized éponine by the arm swear one thing to me swear said she what does that mean come you want me to swear and she laughed your father promise me éponine swear to me that you

ahead and follow me so without seeming to do it a nice young man like you must not be seen with a woman like me no tongue can express all that lay in that word woman thus pronounced by that child she proceeded a dozen paces and then halted once more marius joined her she addressed him sideways and without turning towards him by the way you know that you promised me something marius fumbled in his pocket all that he owned in the world was the five francs intended for thénardier the father he took them and laid them in éponine s hand she opened her fingers and let the coin fall to the ground and gazed at him with a gloomy air i don t want your money said she book third the house in the rue plumet chapter i the house with a secret about the middle of the last century a chief justice in the parliament of paris having a mistress and concealing the fact for at that period the grand seignors displayed their mistresses and the bourgeois concealed them had a little house built in the faubourg saint germain in the deserted rue blomet which is now called rue plumet not far from the spot which was then designated as combat des animaux this house was composed of a single storied pavilion two rooms on the ground floor two chambers on the first floor a kitchen down stairs a boudoir upstairs an attic under the roof the whole preceded by a garden with a large gate opening on the street this garden was about an acre and a half in extent this was all that could be seen by passers by but behind the pavilion there was a narrow courtyard and at the end of the courtyard a low building consisting of two rooms and a cellar a sort of preparation destined to conceal a child and nurse in case of need this building communicated in the rear by a masked door which opened by a secret spring with a long narrow paved winding corridor open to the sky hemmed in with two lofty walls which hidden with wonderful art and lost as it were between garden enclosures and cultivated land all of whose angles and detours it followed ended in another door also with a secret lock which opened a quarter of a league away almost in another quarter at the solitary extremity of the rue du babylone through this the chief justice entered so that even those who were spying on him and following him would merely have observed that the justice betook himself every day in a mysterious way somewhere and would never have suspected that to go to the rue de babylone was to go to the rue blomet thanks to clever purchasers of land the magistrate had been able to make a secret sewer like passage on his own property and consequently without interference later on he had sold in little parcels for gardens and market gardens the lots of ground adjoining the corridor and the proprietors of these lots on both sides thought they had a party wall before their eyes and did not even suspect the long paved ribbon winding between two walls amid their flower beds and their orchards only the birds beheld this curiosity it is probable that the linnets and tomtits of the last century gossiped a great deal about the chief justice the pavilion built of stone in the taste of mansard wainscoted and furnished in the watteau style rocaille on the inside old fashioned on the outside walled in with a triple hedge of flowers had something discreet coquettish and solemn about it as befits a caprice of love and magistracy this house and corridor which have now disappeared were in existence fifteen years ago in 93 a coppersmith had purchased the house with the idea of demolishing it but had not been able to pay the price the nation made him bankrupt so that it was the house which demolished the coppersmith after that the house remained uninhabited and fell slowly to ruin as does every dwelling to which the presence of man does not communicate life it had remained fitted with its old furniture was always for sale or to let and the ten or a dozen people who passed through the rue plumet were warned of the fact by a yellow and illegible bit of writing which had hung on the garden wall since 1819 towards the end of the restoration these same passers by might have noticed that the bill had disappeared and even that the shutters on the first floor were open the house was occupied in fact the windows had short curtains a sign that there was a woman about in the month of october 1829 a man of a certain age had presented himself and had hired the house just as it stood including of course the back building and the lane which ended in the rue de babylone he had had the secret openings of the two doors to this passage repaired the house as we have just mentioned was still very nearly furnished with the justice s old fitting the new tenant had ordered some repairs had added what was lacking here and there had replaced the paving stones in the yard bricks in the floors steps in the stairs missing bits in the inlaid floors and the glass in the lattice windows and had finally installed himself there with a young girl and an elderly maid servant without commotion rather like a person who is slipping in than like a man who is entering his own house the neighbors did not gossip about him for the reason that there were no neighbors this unobtrusive tenant was jean valjean the young girl was cosette the servant was a woman named toussaint whom jean valjean had saved from the hospital and from wretchedness and who was elderly a stammerer and from the provinces three qualities which had decided jean valjean to take her with him he had hired the house under the name of m fauchelevent independent gentleman in all that has been related heretofore the reader has doubtless been no less prompt than thénardier to recognize jean valjean why had jean valjean quitted the convent of the petit picpus what had happened nothing had happened it will be remembered that jean valjean was happy in the convent so happy that his conscience finally took the alarm he saw cosette every day he felt paternity spring up and develop within him more and more he brooded over the soul of that child he said to himself that she was his that nothing could take her from him that this would last indefinitely that she would certainly become a nun being thereto gently incited every day that thus the convent was henceforth the universe for her as it was for him that he should grow old there and that she would grow up there that she would grow old there and that he should die there that in short delightful hope no separation was possible on reflecting upon this he fell into perplexity he interrogated himself he asked himself if all that happiness were really his if it were not composed of the happiness of another of the happiness of that child which he an old man was confiscating and stealing if that were not theft he said to himself that this child had a right to know life before renouncing it that to deprive her in advance and in some sort without consulting her of all joys under the pretext of saving her from all trials to take advantage of her ignorance of her isolation in order to make an artificial vocation germinate in her was to rob a human creature of its nature and to lie to god and who knows if when she came to be aware of all this some day and found herself a nun to her sorrow cosette would not come to hate him a last almost selfish thought and less heroic than the rest but which was intolerable to him he resolved to quit the convent he resolved on this he recognized with anguish the fact that it was necessary as for objections there were none five years sojourn between these four walls and of disappearance had necessarily destroyed or dispersed the elements of fear he could return tranquilly among men he had grown old and all had undergone a change who would recognize him now and then to face the worst there was danger only for himself and he had no right to condemn cosette to the cloister for the reason that he had been condemned to the galleys besides what is danger in comparison with the right finally nothing prevented his being prudent and taking his precautions as for cosette s education it was almost finished and complete his determination once taken he awaited an opportunity it was not long in presenting itself old fauchelevent died jean valjean demanded an audience with the revered prioress and told her that having come into a little inheritance at the death of his brother which permitted him henceforth to live without working he should leave the service of the convent and take his daughter with him but that as it was not just that cosette since she had not taken the vows should have received her education gratuitously he humbly begged the reverend prioress to see fit that he should offer to the community as indemnity for the five years which cosette had spent there the sum of five thousand francs it was thus that jean valjean quitted the convent of the perpetual adoration on leaving the convent he took in his own arms the little valise the key to which he still wore on his person and would permit no porter to touch it this puzzled cosette because of the odor of embalming which proceeded from it let us state at once that this trunk never quitted him more he always had it in his chamber it was the first and only thing sometimes that he carried off in his moving when he moved about cosette laughed at it and called this valise his inseparable saying i am jealous of it nevertheless jean valjean did not reappear in the open air without profound anxiety he discovered the house in the rue plumet and hid himself from sight there henceforth he was in the possession of the name ultime fauchelevent at the same time he hired two other apartments in paris in order that he might attract less attention than if he were to remain always in the same quarter and so that he could at need take himself off at the slightest disquietude which should assail him and in short so that he might not again be caught unprovided as on the night when he had so miraculously escaped from javert these two apartments were very pitiable poor in appearance and in two quarters which were far remote from each other the one in the rue de l ouest the other in the rue de l homme armé he went from time to time now to the rue de l homme armé now to the rue de l ouest to pass a month or six weeks without taking toussaint he had himself served by the porters and gave himself out as a gentleman from the suburbs living on his funds and having a little temporary resting place in town this lofty virtue had three domiciles in paris for the sake of escaping from the police chapter ii jean valjean as a national guard however properly speaking he lived in the rue plumet and he had arranged his existence there in the following fashion cosette and the servant occupied the pavilion she had the big sleeping room with the painted pier glasses the boudoir with the gilded fillets the justice s drawing room furnished with tapestries and vast arm chairs she had the garden jean valjean had a canopied bed of antique damask in three colors and a beautiful persian rug purchased in the rue du figuier saint paul at mother gaucher s put into cosette s chamber and in order to redeem the severity of these magnificent old things he had amalgamated with this bric à brac all the gay and graceful little pieces of furniture suitable to young girls an étagère a bookcase filled with gilt edged books an inkstand a blotting book paper a work table incrusted with mother of pearl a silver gilt dressing case a toilet service in japanese porcelain long damask curtains with a red foundation and three colors like those on the bed hung at the windows of the first floor on the ground floor the curtains were of tapestry all winter long cosette s little house was heated from top to bottom jean valjean inhabited the sort of porter s lodge which was situated at the end of the back courtyard with a mattress on a folding bed a white wood table two straw chairs an earthenware water jug a few old volumes on a shelf his beloved valise in one corner and never any fire he dined with cosette and he had a loaf of black bread on the table for his own use when toussaint came he had said to her it is the young lady who is the mistress of this house and you monsieur toussaint replied in amazement i am a much better thing than the master i am the father cosette had been taught housekeeping in the convent and she regulated their expenditure which was very modest every day jean valjean put his arm through cosette s and took her for a walk he led her to the luxembourg to the least frequented walk and every sunday he took her to mass at saint jacques du haut pas because that was a long way off as it was a very poor quarter he bestowed alms largely there and the poor people surrounded him in church which had drawn down upon him thénardier s epistle to the benevolent gentleman of the church of saint jacques du haut pas he was fond of taking cosette to visit the poor and the sick no stranger ever entered the house in the rue plumet toussaint brought their provisions and jean valjean went himself for water to a fountain near by on the boulevard their wood and wine were put into a half subterranean hollow lined with rock work which lay near the rue de babylone and which had formerly served the chief justice as a grotto for at the epoch of follies and little houses no love was without a grotto in the door opening on the rue de babylone there was a box destined for the reception of letters and papers only as the three inhabitants of the pavilion in the rue plumet received neither papers nor letters the entire usefulness of that box formerly the go between of a love affair and the confidant of a love lorn lawyer was now limited to the tax collector s notices and the summons of the guard for m fauchelevent independent gentleman belonged to the national guard he had not been able to escape through the fine meshes of the census of 1831 the municipal information collected at that time had even reached the convent of the petit picpus a sort of impenetrable and holy cloud whence jean valjean had emerged in venerable guise and consequently worthy of mounting guard in the eyes of the town hall three or four times a year jean valjean donned his uniform and mounted guard he did this willingly however it was a correct disguise which mixed him with every one and yet left him solitary jean valjean had just attained his sixtieth birthday the age of legal exemption but he did not appear to be over fifty moreover he had no desire to escape his sergeant major nor to quibble with comte de lobau he possessed no civil status he was concealing his name he was concealing his identity so he concealed his age he concealed everything and as we have just said he willingly did his duty as a national guard the sum of his ambition lay in resembling any other man who paid his taxes this man had for his ideal within the angel without the bourgeois let us note one detail however when jean valjean went out with cosette he dressed as the reader has already seen and had the air of a retired officer when he went out alone which was generally at night he was always dressed in a workingman s trousers and blouse and wore a cap which concealed his face was this precaution or humility both cosette was accustomed to the enigmatical side of her destiny and hardly noticed her father s peculiarities as for toussaint she venerated jean valjean and thought everything he did right one day her butcher who had caught a glimpse of jean valjean said to her that s a queer fish she replied he s a saint neither jean valjean nor cosette nor toussaint ever entered or emerged except by the door on the rue de babylone unless seen through the garden gate it would have been difficult to guess that they lived in the rue plumet that gate was always closed jean valjean had left the garden uncultivated in order not to attract attention in this possibly he made a mistake chapter iii foliis ac frondibus the garden thus left to itself for more than half a century had become extraordinary and charming the passers by of forty years ago halted to gaze at it without a suspicion of the secrets which it hid in its fresh and verdant depths more than one dreamer of that epoch often allowed his thoughts and his eyes to penetrate indiscreetly between the bars of that ancient padlocked gate twisted tottering fastened to two green and moss covered pillars and oddly crowned with a pediment of undecipherable arabesque there was a stone bench in one corner one or two mouldy statues several lattices which had lost their nails with time were rotting on the wall and there were no walks nor turf but there was enough grass everywhere gardening had taken its departure and nature had returned weeds abounded which was a great piece of luck for a poor corner of land the festival of gilliflowers was something splendid nothing in this garden obstructed the sacred effort of things towards life venerable growth reigned there among them the trees had bent over towards the nettles the plant had sprung upward the branch had inclined that which crawls on the earth had gone in search of that which expands in the air that which floats on the wind had bent over towards that which trails in the moss trunks boughs leaves fibres clusters tendrils shoots spines thorns had mingled crossed married confounded themselves in each other vegetation in a deep and close embrace had celebrated and accomplished there under the well pleased eye of the creator in that enclosure three hundred feet square the holy mystery of fraternity symbol of the human fraternity this garden was no longer a garden it was a colossal thicket that is to say something as impenetrable as a forest as peopled as a city quivering like a nest sombre like a cathedral fragrant like a bouquet solitary as a tomb living as a throng in floréal34 this enormous thicket free behind its gate and within its four walls entered upon the secret labor of germination quivered in the rising sun almost like an animal which drinks in the breaths of cosmic love and which feels the sap of april rising and boiling in its veins and shakes to the wind its enormous wonderful green locks sprinkled on the damp earth on the defaced statues on the crumbling steps of the pavilion and even on the pavement of the deserted street flowers like stars dew like pearls fecundity beauty life joy perfumes at midday a thousand white butterflies took refuge there and it was a divine spectacle to see that living summer snow whirling about there in flakes amid the shade there in those gay shadows of verdure a throng of innocent voices spoke sweetly to the soul and what the twittering forgot to say the humming completed in the evening a dreamy vapor exhaled from the garden and enveloped it a shroud of mist a calm and celestial sadness covered it the intoxicating perfume of the honeysuckles and convolvulus poured out from every part of it like an exquisite and subtle poison the last appeals of the woodpeckers and the wagtails were audible as they dozed among the branches one felt the sacred intimacy of the birds and the trees by day the wings rejoice the leaves by night the leaves protect the wings in winter the thicket was black dripping bristling shivering and allowed some glimpse of the house instead of flowers on the branches and dew in the flowers the long silvery tracks of the snails were visible on the cold thick carpet of yellow leaves but in any fashion under any aspect at all seasons spring winter summer autumn this tiny enclosure breathed forth melancholy contemplation solitude liberty the absence of man the presence of god and the rusty old gate had the air of saying this garden belongs to me it was of no avail that the pavements of paris were there on every side the classic and splendid hotels of the rue de varennes a couple of paces away the dome of the invalides close at hand the chamber of deputies not far off the carriages of the rue de bourgogne and of the rue saint dominique rumbled luxuriously in vain in the vicinity in vain did the yellow brown white and red omnibuses cross each other s course at the neighboring cross roads the rue plumet was the desert and the death of the former proprietors the revolution which had passed over it the crumbling away of ancient fortunes absence forgetfulness forty years of abandonment and widowhood had sufficed to restore to this privileged spot ferns mulleins hemlock yarrow tall weeds great crimped plants with large leaves of pale green cloth lizards beetles uneasy and rapid insects to cause to spring forth from the depths of the earth and to reappear between those four walls a certain indescribable and savage grandeur and for nature which disconcerts the petty arrangements of man and which sheds herself always thoroughly where she diffuses herself at all in the ant as well as in the eagle to blossom out in a petty little parisian garden with as much rude force and majesty as in a virgin forest of the new world nothing is small in fact any one who is subject to the profound and penetrating influence of nature knows this although no absolute satisfaction is given to philosophy either to circumscribe the cause or to limit the effect the contemplator falls into those unfathomable ecstasies caused by these decompositions of force terminating in unity everything toils at everything algebra is applied to the clouds the radiation of the star profits the rose no thinker would venture to affirm that the perfume of the hawthorn is useless to the constellations who then can calculate the course of a molecule how do we know that the creation of worlds is not determined by the fall of grains of sand who knows the reciprocal ebb and flow of the infinitely great and the infinitely little the reverberations of causes in the precipices of being and the avalanches of creation the tiniest worm is of importance the great is little the little is great everything is balanced in necessity alarming vision for the mind there are marvellous relations between beings and things in that inexhaustible whole from the sun to the grub nothing despises the other all have need of each other the light does not bear away terrestrial perfumes into the azure depths without knowing what it is doing the night distributes stellar essences to the sleeping flowers all birds that fly have round their leg the thread of the infinite germination is complicated with the bursting forth of a meteor and with the peck of a swallow cracking its egg and it places on one level the birth of an earthworm and the advent of socrates where the telescope ends the microscope begins which of the two possesses the larger field of vision choose a bit of mould is a pleiad of flowers a nebula is an ant hill of stars the same promiscuousness and yet more unprecedented exists between the things of the intelligence and the facts of substance elements and principles mingle combine wed multiply with each other to such a point that the material and the moral world are brought eventually to the same clearness the phenomenon is perpetually returning upon itself in the vast cosmic exchanges the universal life goes and comes in unknown quantities rolling entirely in the invisible mystery of effluvia employing everything not losing a single dream not a single slumber sowing an animalcule here crumbling to bits a planet there oscillating and winding making of light a force and of thought an element disseminated and invisible dissolving all except that geometrical point the i bringing everything back to the soul atom expanding everything in god entangling all activity from summit to base in the obscurity of a dizzy mechanism attaching the flight of an insect to the movement of the earth subordinating who knows were it only by the identity of the law the evolution of the comet in the firmament to the whirling of the infusoria in the drop of water a machine made of mind enormous gearing the prime motor of which is the gnat and whose final wheel is the zodiac chapter iv change of gate it seemed that this garden created in olden days to conceal wanton mysteries had been transformed and become fitted to shelter chaste mysteries there were no longer either arbors or bowling greens or tunnels or grottos there was a magnificent dishevelled obscurity falling like a veil over all paphos had been made over into eden it is impossible to say what element of repentance had rendered this retreat wholesome this flower girl now offered her blossom to the soul this coquettish garden formerly decidedly compromised had returned to virginity and modesty a justice assisted by a gardener a goodman who thought that he was a continuation of lamoignon and another goodman who thought that he was a continuation of lenôtre had turned it about cut ruffled decked moulded it to gallantry nature had taken possession of it once more had filled it with shade and had arranged it for love there was also in this solitude a heart which was quite ready love had only to show himself he had here a temple composed of verdure grass moss the sight of birds tender shadows agitated branches and a soul made of sweetness of faith of candor of hope of aspiration and of illusion cosette had left the convent when she was still almost a child she was a little more than fourteen and she was at the ungrateful age we have already said that with the exception of her eyes she was homely rather than pretty she had no ungraceful feature but she was awkward thin timid and bold at once a grown up little girl in short her education was finished that is to say she has been taught religion and even and above all devotion then history that is to say the thing that bears that name in convents geography grammar the participles the kings of france a little music a little drawing etc but in all other respects she was utterly ignorant which is a great charm and a great peril the soul of a young girl should not be left in the dark later on mirages that are too abrupt and too lively are formed there as in a dark chamber she should be gently and discreetly enlightened rather with the reflection of realities than with their harsh and direct light a useful and graciously austere half light which dissipates puerile fears and obviates falls there is nothing but the maternal instinct that admirable intuition composed of the memories of the virgin and the experience of the woman which knows how this half light is to be created and of what it should consist nothing supplies the place of this instinct all the nuns in the world are not worth as much as one mother in the formation of a young girl s soul cosette had had no mother she had only had many mothers in the plural as for jean valjean he was indeed all tenderness all solicitude but he was only an old man and he knew nothing at all now in this work of education in this grave matter of preparing a woman for life what science is required to combat that vast ignorance which is called innocence nothing prepares a young girl for passions like the convent the convent turns the thoughts in the direction of the unknown the heart thus thrown back upon itself works downward within itself since it cannot overflow and grows deep since it cannot expand hence visions suppositions conjectures outlines of romances a desire for adventures fantastic constructions edifices built wholly in the inner obscurity of the mind sombre and secret abodes where the passions immediately find a lodgement as soon as the open gate permits them to enter the convent is a compression which in order to triumph over the human heart should last during the whole life on quitting the convent cosette could have found nothing more sweet and more dangerous than the house in the rue plumet it was the continuation of solitude with the beginning of liberty a garden that was closed but a nature that was acrid rich voluptuous and fragrant the same dreams as in the convent but with glimpses of young men a grating but one that opened on the street still when she arrived there we repeat she was only a child jean valjean gave this neglected garden over to her do what you like with it he said to her this amused cosette she turned over all the clumps and all the stones she hunted for beasts she played in it while awaiting the time when she would dream in it she loved this garden for the insects that she found beneath her feet amid the grass while awaiting the day when she would love it for the stars that she would see through the boughs above her head and then she loved her father that is to say jean valjean with all her soul with an innocent filial passion which made the goodman a beloved and charming companion to her it will be remembered that m madeleine had been in the habit of reading a great deal jean valjean had continued this practice he had come to converse well he possessed the secret riches and the eloquence of a true and humble mind which has spontaneously cultivated itself he retained just enough sharpness to season his kindness his mind was rough and his heart was soft during their conversations in the luxembourg he gave her explanations of everything drawing on what he had read and also on what he had suffered as she listened to him cosette s eyes wandered vaguely about this simple man sufficed for cosette s thought the same as the wild garden sufficed for her eyes when she had had a good chase after the butterflies she came panting up to him and said ah how i have run he kissed her brow cosette adored the goodman she was always at his heels where jean valjean was there happiness was jean valjean lived neither in the pavilion nor the garden she took greater pleasure in the paved back courtyard than in the enclosure filled with flowers and in his little lodge furnished with straw seated chairs than in the great drawing room hung with tapestry against which stood tufted easy chairs jean valjean sometimes said to her smiling at his happiness in being importuned do go to your own quarters leave me alone a little she gave him those charming and tender scoldings which are so graceful when they come from a daughter to her father father i am very cold in your rooms why don t you have a carpet here and a stove dear child there are so many people who are better than i and who have not even a roof over their heads then why is there a fire in my rooms and everything that is needed because you are a woman and a child bah must men be cold and feel uncomfortable certain men that is good i shall come here so often that you will be obliged to have a fire and again she said to him father why do you eat horrible bread like that because my daughter well if you eat it i will eat it too then in order to prevent cosette eating black bread jean valjean ate white bread cosette had but a confused recollection of her childhood she prayed morning and evening for her mother whom she had never known the thénardiers had remained with her as two hideous figures in a dream she remembered that she had gone one day at night to fetch water in a forest she thought that it had been very far from paris it seemed to her that she had begun to live in an abyss and that it was jean valjean who had rescued her from it her childhood produced upon her the effect of a time when there had been nothing around her but millepeds spiders and serpents when she meditated in the evening before falling asleep as she had not a very clear idea that she was jean valjean s daughter and that he was her father she fancied that the soul of her mother had passed into that good man and had come to dwell near her when he was seated she leaned her cheek against his white hair and dropped a silent tear saying to herself perhaps this man is my mother cosette although this is a strange statement to make in the profound ignorance of a girl brought up in a convent maternity being also absolutely unintelligible to virginity had ended by fancying that she had had as little mother as possible she did not even know her mother s name whenever she asked jean valjean jean valjean remained silent if she repeated her question he responded with a smile once she insisted the smile ended in a tear this silence on the part of jean valjean covered fantine with darkness was it prudence was it respect was it a fear that he should deliver this name to the hazards of another memory than his own so long as cosette had been small jean valjean had been willing to talk to her of her mother when she became a young girl it was impossible for him to do so it seemed to him that he no longer dared was it because of cosette was it because of fantine he felt a certain religious horror at letting that shadow enter cosette s thought and of placing a third in their destiny the more sacred this shade was to him the more did it seem that it was to be feared he thought of fantine and felt himself overwhelmed with silence through the darkness he vaguely perceived something which appeared to have its finger on its lips had all the modesty which had been in fantine and which had violently quitted her during her lifetime returned to rest upon her after her death to watch in indignation over the peace of that dead woman and in its shyness to keep her in her grave was jean valjean unconsciously submitting to the pressure we who believe in death are not among the number who will reject this mysterious explanation hence the impossibility of uttering even for cosette that name of fantine one day cosette said to him father i saw my mother in a dream last night she had two big wings my mother must have been almost a saint during her life through martyrdom replied jean valjean however jean valjean was happy when cosette went out with him she leaned on his arm proud and happy in the plenitude of her heart jean valjean felt his heart melt within him with delight at all these sparks of a tenderness so exclusive so wholly satisfied with himself alone the poor man trembled inundated with angelic joy he declared to himself ecstatically that this would last all their lives he told himself that he really had not suffered sufficiently to merit so radiant a bliss and he thanked god in the depths of his soul for having permitted him to be loved thus he a wretch by that innocent being chapter v the rose perceives that it is an engine of war one day cosette chanced to look at herself in her mirror and she said to herself really it seemed to her almost that she was pretty this threw her in a singularly troubled state of mind up to that moment she had never thought of her face she saw herself in her mirror but she did not look at herself and then she had so often been told that she was homely jean valjean alone said gently no indeed no indeed at all events cosette had always thought herself homely and had grown up in that belief with the easy resignation of childhood and here all at once was her mirror saying to her as jean valjean had said no indeed that night she did not sleep what if i were pretty she thought how odd it would be if i were pretty and she recalled those of her companions whose beauty had produced a sensation in the convent and she said to herself what am i to be like mademoiselle so and so the next morning she looked at herself again not by accident this time and she was assailed with doubts where did i get such an idea said she no i am ugly she had not slept well that was all her eyes were sunken and she was pale she had not felt very joyous on the preceding evening in the belief that she was beautiful but it made her very sad not to be able to believe in it any longer she did not look at herself again and for more than a fortnight she tried to dress her hair with her back turned to the mirror in the evening after dinner she generally embroidered in wool or did some convent needlework in the drawing room and jean valjean read beside her once she raised her eyes from her work and was rendered quite uneasy by the manner in which her father was gazing at her on another occasion she was passing along the street and it seemed to her that some one behind her whom she did not see said a pretty woman but badly dressed bah she thought he does not mean me i am well dressed and ugly she was then wearing a plush hat and her merino gown at last one day when she was in the garden she heard poor old toussaint saying do you notice how pretty cosette is growing sir cosette did not hear her father s reply but toussaint s words caused a sort of commotion within her she fled from the garden ran up to her room flew to the looking glass it was three months since she had looked at herself and gave vent to a cry she had just dazzled herself she was beautiful and lovely she could not help agreeing with toussaint and her mirror her figure was formed her skin had grown white her hair was lustrous an unaccustomed splendor had been lighted in her blue eyes the consciousness of her beauty burst upon her in an instant like the sudden advent of daylight other people noticed it also toussaint had said so it was evidently she of whom the passer by had spoken there could no longer be any doubt of that she descended to the garden again thinking herself a queen imagining that she heard the birds singing though it was winter seeing the sky gilded the sun among the trees flowers in the thickets distracted wild in inexpressible delight jean valjean on his side experienced a deep and undefinable oppression at heart in fact he had for some time past been contemplating with terror that beauty which seemed to grow more radiant every day on cosette s sweet face the dawn that was smiling for all was gloomy for him cosette had been beautiful for a tolerably long time before she became aware of it herself but from the very first day that unexpected light which was rising slowly and enveloping the whole of the young girl s person wounded jean valjean s sombre eye he felt that it was a change in a happy life a life so happy that he did not dare to move for fear of disarranging something this man who had passed through all manner of distresses who was still all bleeding from the bruises of fate who had been almost wicked and who had become almost a saint who after having dragged the chain of the galleys was now dragging the invisible but heavy chain of indefinite misery this man whom the law had not released from its grasp and who could be seized at any moment and brought back from the obscurity of his virtue to the broad daylight of public opprobrium this man accepted all excused all pardoned all and merely asked of providence of man of the law of society of nature of the world one thing that cosette might love him that cosette might continue to love him that god would not prevent the heart of the child from coming to him and from remaining with him beloved by cosette he felt that he was healed rested appeased loaded with benefits recompensed crowned beloved by cosette it was well with him he asked nothing more had any one said to him do you want anything better he would have answered no god might have said to him do you desire heaven and he would have replied i should lose by it everything which could affect this situation if only on the surface made him shudder like the beginning of something new he had never known very distinctly himself what the beauty of a woman means but he understood instinctively that it was something terrible he gazed with terror on this beauty which was blossoming out ever more triumphant and superb beside him beneath his very eyes on the innocent and formidable brow of that child from the depths of her homeliness of his old age of his misery of his reprobation he said to himself how beautiful she is what is to become of me there moreover lay the difference between his tenderness and the tenderness of a mother what he beheld with anguish a mother would have gazed upon with joy the first symptoms were not long in making their appearance on the very morrow of the day on which she had said to herself decidedly i am beautiful cosette began to pay attention to her toilet she recalled the remark of that passer by pretty but badly dressed the breath of an oracle which had passed beside her and had vanished after depositing in her heart one of the two germs which are destined later on to fill the whole life of woman coquetry love is the other with faith in her beauty the whole feminine soul expanded within her she conceived a horror for her merinos and shame for her plush hat her father had never refused her anything she at once acquired the whole science of the bonnet the gown the mantle the boot the cuff the stuff which is in fashion the color which is becoming that science which makes of the parisian woman something so charming so deep and so dangerous the words heady woman were invented for the parisienne in less than a month little cosette in that thebaid of the rue de babylone was not only one of the prettiest but one of the best dressed women in paris which means a great deal more she would have liked to encounter her passer by to see what he would say and to teach him a lesson the truth is that she was ravishing in every respect and that she distinguished the difference between a bonnet from gérard and one from herbaut in the most marvellous way jean valjean watched these ravages with anxiety he who felt that he could never do anything but crawl walk at the most beheld wings sprouting on cosette moreover from the mere inspection of cosette s toilet a woman would have recognized the fact that she had no mother certain little proprieties certain special conventionalities were not observed by cosette a mother for instance would have told her that a young girl does not dress in damask the first day that cosette went out in her black damask gown and mantle and her white crape bonnet she took jean valjean s arm gay radiant rosy proud dazzling father she said how do you like me in this guise jean valjean replied in a voice which resembled the bitter voice of an envious man charming he was the same as usual during their walk on their return home he asked cosette won t you put on that other gown and bonnet again you know the ones i mean this took place in cosette s chamber cosette turned towards the wardrobe where her cast off schoolgirl s clothes were hanging that disguise said she father what do you want me to do with it oh no the idea i shall never put on those horrors again with that machine on my head i have the air of madame mad dog jean valjean heaved a deep sigh from that moment forth he noticed that cosette who had always heretofore asked to remain at home saying father i enjoy myself more here with you now was always asking to go out in fact what is the use of having a handsome face and a delicious costume if one does not display them he also noticed that cosette had no longer the same taste for the back garden now she preferred the garden and did not dislike to promenade back and forth in front of the railed fence jean valjean who was shy never set foot in the garden he kept to his back yard like a dog cosette in gaining the knowledge that she was beautiful lost the grace of ignoring it an exquisite grace for beauty enhanced by ingenuousness is ineffable and nothing is so adorable as a dazzling and innocent creature who walks along holding in her hand the key to paradise without being conscious of it but what she had lost in ingenuous grace she gained in pensive and serious charm her whole person permeated with the joy of youth of innocence and of beauty breathed forth a splendid melancholy it was at this epoch that marius after the lapse of six months saw her once more at the luxembourg chapter vi the battle begun cosette in her shadow like marius in his was all ready to take fire destiny with its mysterious and fatal patience slowly drew together these two beings all charged and all languishing with the stormy electricity of passion these two souls which were laden with love as two clouds are laden with lightning and which were bound to overflow and mingle in a look like the clouds in a flash of fire the glance has been so much abused in love romances that it has finally fallen into disrepute one hardly dares to say nowadays that two beings fell in love because they looked at each other that is the way people do fall in love nevertheless and the only way the rest is nothing but the rest comes afterwards nothing is more real than these great shocks which two souls convey to each other by the exchange of that spark at that particular hour when cosette unconsciously darted that glance which troubled marius marius had no suspicion that he had also launched a look which disturbed cosette he caused her the same good and the same evil she had been in the habit of seeing him for a long time and she had scrutinized him as girls scrutinize and see while looking elsewhere marius still considered cosette ugly when she had already begun to think marius handsome but as he paid no attention to her the young man was nothing to her still she could not refrain from saying to herself that he had beautiful hair beautiful eyes handsome teeth a charming tone of voice when she heard him conversing with his comrades that he held himself badly when he walked if you like but with a grace that was all his own that he did not appear to be at all stupid that his whole person was noble gentle simple proud and that in short though he seemed to be poor yet his air was fine on the day when their eyes met at last and said to each other those first obscure and ineffable things which the glance lisps cosette did not immediately understand she returned thoughtfully to the house in the rue de l ouest where jean valjean according to his custom had come to spend six weeks the next morning on waking she thought of that strange young man so long indifferent and icy who now seemed to pay attention to her and it did not appear to her that this attention was the least in the world agreeable to her she was on the contrary somewhat incensed at this handsome and disdainful individual a substratum of war stirred within her it struck her and the idea caused her a wholly childish joy that she was going to take her revenge at last knowing that she was beautiful she was thoroughly conscious though in an indistinct fashion that she possessed a weapon women play with their beauty as children do with a knife they wound themselves the reader will recall marius hesitations his palpitations his terrors he remained on his bench and did not approach this vexed cosette one day she said to jean valjean father let us stroll about a little in that direction seeing that marius did not come to her she went to him in such cases all women resemble mahomet and then strange to say the first symptom of true love in a young man is timidity in a young girl it is boldness this is surprising and yet nothing is more simple it is the two sexes tending to approach each other and assuming each the other s qualities that day cosette s glance drove marius beside himself and marius glance set cosette to trembling marius went away confident and cosette uneasy from that day forth they adored each other the first thing that cosette felt was a confused and profound melancholy it seemed to her that her soul had become black since the day before she no longer recognized it the whiteness of soul in young girls which is composed of coldness and gayety resembles snow it melts in love which is its sun cosette did not know what love was she had never heard the word uttered in its terrestrial sense on the books of profane music which entered the convent amour love was replaced by tambour drum or pandour this created enigmas which exercised the imaginations of the big girls such as ah how delightful is the drum or pity is not a pandour but cosette had left the convent too early to have occupied herself much with the drum therefore she did not know what name to give to what she now felt is any one the less ill because one does not know the name of one s malady she loved with all the more passion because she loved ignorantly she did not know whether it was a good thing or a bad thing useful or dangerous eternal or temporary allowable or prohibited she loved she would have been greatly astonished had any one said to her you do not sleep but that is forbidden you do not eat why that is very bad you have oppressions and palpitations of the heart that must not be you blush and turn pale when a certain being clad in black appears at the end of a certain green walk but that is abominable she would not have understood and she would have replied what fault is there of mine in a matter in which i have no power and of which i know nothing it turned out that the love which presented itself was exactly suited to the state of her soul it was a sort of admiration at a distance a mute contemplation the deification of a stranger it was the apparition of youth to youth the dream of nights become a reality yet remaining a dream the longed for phantom realized and made flesh at last but having as yet neither name nor fault nor spot nor exigence nor defect in a word the distant lover who lingered in the ideal a chimæra with a form any nearer and more palpable meeting would have alarmed cosette at this first stage when she was still half immersed in the exaggerated mists of the cloister she had all the fears of children and all the fears of nuns combined the spirit of the convent with which she had been permeated for the space of five years was still in the process of slow evaporation from her person and made everything tremble around her in this situation he was not a lover he was not even an admirer he was a vision she set herself to adoring marius as something charming luminous and impossible as extreme innocence borders on extreme coquetry she smiled at him with all frankness every day she looked forward to the hour for their walk with impatience she found marius there she felt herself unspeakably happy and thought in all sincerity that she was expressing her whole thought when she said to jean valjean what a delicious garden that luxembourg is marius and cosette were in the dark as to one another they did not address each other they did not salute each other they did not know each other they saw each other and like stars of heaven which are separated by millions of leagues they lived by gazing at each other it was thus that cosette gradually became a woman and developed beautiful and loving with a consciousness of her beauty and in ignorance of her love she was a coquette to boot through her ignorance chapter vii to one sadness oppose a sadness and a half all situations have their instincts old and eternal mother nature warned jean valjean in a dim way of the presence of marius jean valjean shuddered to the very bottom of his soul jean valjean saw nothing knew nothing and yet he scanned with obstinate attention the darkness in which he walked as though he felt on one side of him something in process of construction and on the other something which was crumbling away marius also warned and in accordance with the deep law of god by that same mother nature did all he could to keep out of sight of the father nevertheless it came to pass that jean valjean sometimes espied him marius manners were no longer in the least natural he exhibited ambiguous prudence and awkward daring he no longer came quite close to them as formerly he seated himself at a distance and pretended to be reading why did he pretend that formerly he had come in his old coat now he wore his new one every day jean valjean was not sure that he did not have his hair curled his eyes were very queer he wore gloves in short jean valjean cordially detested this young man cosette allowed nothing to be divined without knowing just what was the matter with her she was convinced that there was something in it and that it must be concealed there was a coincidence between the taste for the toilet which had recently come to cosette and the habit of new clothes developed by that stranger which was very repugnant to jean valjean it might be accidental no doubt certainly but it was a menacing accident he never opened his mouth to cosette about this stranger one day however he could not refrain from so doing and with that vague despair which suddenly casts the lead into the depths of its despair he said to her what a very pedantic air that young man has cosette but a year before only an indifferent little girl would have replied why no he is charming ten years later with the love of marius in her heart she would have answered a pedant and insufferable to the sight you are right at the moment in life and the heart which she had then attained she contented herself with replying with supreme calmness that young man as though she now beheld him for the first time in her life how stupid i am thought jean valjean she had not noticed him it is i who have pointed him out to her oh simplicity of the old oh the depth of children it is one of the laws of those fresh years of suffering and trouble of those vivacious conflicts between a first love and the first obstacles that the young girl does not allow herself to be caught in any trap whatever and that the young man falls into every one jean valjean had instituted an undeclared war against marius which marius with the sublime stupidity of his passion and his age did not divine jean valjean laid a host of ambushes for him he changed his hour he changed his bench he forgot his handkerchief he came alone to the luxembourg marius dashed headlong into all these snares and to all the interrogation marks planted by jean valjean in his pathway he ingenuously answered yes but cosette remained immured in her apparent unconcern and in her imperturbable tranquillity so that jean valjean arrived at the following conclusion that ninny is madly in love with cosette but cosette does not even know that he exists none the less did he bear in his heart a mournful tremor the minute when cosette would love might strike at any moment does not everything begin with indifference only once did cosette make a mistake and alarm him he rose from his seat to depart after a stay of three hours and she said what already jean valjean had not discontinued his trips to the luxembourg as he did not wish to do anything out of the way and as above all things he feared to arouse cosette but during the hours which were so sweet to the lovers while cosette was sending her smile to the intoxicated marius who perceived nothing else now and who now saw nothing in all the world but an adored and radiant face jean valjean was fixing on marius flashing and terrible eyes he who had finally come to believe himself incapable of a malevolent feeling experienced moments when marius was present in which he thought he was becoming savage and ferocious once more and he felt the old depths of his soul which had formerly contained so much wrath opening once more and rising up against that young man it almost seemed to him that unknown craters were forming in his bosom what he was there that creature what was he there for he came creeping about smelling out examining trying he came saying hey why not he came to prowl about his jean valjean s life to prowl about his happiness with the purpose of seizing it and bearing it away jean valjean added yes that s it what is he in search of an adventure what does he want a love affair a love affair and i what i have been first the most wretched of men and then the most unhappy and i have traversed sixty years of life on my knees i have suffered everything that man can suffer i have grown old without having been young i have lived without a family without relatives without friends without life without children i have left my blood on every stone on every bramble on every mile post along every wall i have been gentle though others have been hard to me and kind although others have been malicious i have become an honest man once more in spite of everything i have repented of the evil that i have done and have forgiven the evil that has been done to me and at the moment when i receive my recompense at the moment when it is all over at the moment when i am just touching the goal at the moment when i have what i desire it is well it is good i have paid i have earned it all this is to take flight all this will vanish and i shall lose cosette and i shall lose my life my joy my soul because it has pleased a great booby to come and lounge at the luxembourg then his eyes were filled with a sad and extraordinary gleam it was no longer a man gazing at a man it was no longer an enemy surveying an enemy it was a dog scanning a thief the reader knows the rest marius pursued his senseless course one day he followed cosette to the rue de l ouest another day he spoke to the porter the porter on his side spoke and said to jean valjean monsieur who is that curious young man who is asking for you on the morrow jean valjean bestowed on marius that glance which marius at last perceived a week later jean valjean had taken his departure he swore to himself that he would never again set foot either in the luxembourg or in the rue de l ouest he returned to the rue plumet cosette did not complain she said nothing she asked no questions she did not seek to learn his reasons she had already reached the point where she was afraid of being divined and of betraying herself jean valjean had no experience of these miseries the only miseries which are charming and the only ones with which he was not acquainted the consequence was that he did not understand the grave significance of cosette s silence he merely noticed that she had grown sad and he grew gloomy on his side and on hers inexperience had joined issue once he made a trial he asked cosette would you like to come to the luxembourg a ray illuminated cosette s pale face yes said she they went thither three months had elapsed marius no longer went there marius was not there on the following day jean valjean asked cosette again would you like to come to the luxembourg she replied sadly and gently no jean valjean was hurt by this sadness and heart broken at this gentleness what was going on in that mind which was so young and yet already so impenetrable what was on its way there within what was taking place in cosette s soul sometimes instead of going to bed jean valjean remained seated on his pallet with his head in his hands and he passed whole nights asking himself what has cosette in her mind and in thinking of the things that she might be thinking about oh at such moments what mournful glances did he cast towards that cloister that chaste peak that abode of angels that inaccessible glacier of virtue how he contemplated with despairing ecstasy that convent garden full of ignored flowers and cloistered virgins where all perfumes and all souls mount straight to heaven how he adored that eden forever closed against him whence he had voluntarily and madly emerged how he regretted his abnegation and his folly in having brought cosette back into the world poor hero of sacrifice seized and hurled to the earth by his very self devotion how he said to himself what have i done however nothing of all this was perceptible to cosette no ill temper no harshness his face was always serene and kind jean valjean s manners were more tender and more paternal than ever if anything could have betrayed his lack of joy it was his increased suavity on her side cosette languished she suffered from the absence of marius as she had rejoiced in his presence peculiarly without exactly being conscious of it when jean valjean ceased to take her on their customary strolls a feminine instinct murmured confusedly at the bottom of her heart that she must not seem to set store on the luxembourg garden and that if this proved to be a matter of indifference to her her father would take her thither once more but days weeks months elapsed jean valjean had tacitly accepted cosette s tacit consent she regretted it it was too late so marius had disappeared all was over the day on which she returned to the luxembourg marius was no longer there what was to be done should she ever find him again she felt an anguish at her heart which nothing relieved and which augmented every day she no longer knew whether it was winter or summer whether it was raining or shining whether the birds were singing whether it was the season for dahlias or daisies whether the luxembourg was more charming than the tuileries whether the linen which the laundress brought home was starched too much or not enough whether toussaint had done her marketing well or ill and she remained dejected absorbed attentive to but a single thought her eyes vague and staring as when one gazes by night at a black and fathomless spot where an apparition has vanished however she did not allow jean valjean to perceive anything of this except her pallor she still wore her sweet face for him this pallor sufficed but too thoroughly to trouble jean valjean sometimes he asked her what is the matter with you she replied there is nothing the matter with me and after a silence when she divined that he was sad also she would add and you father is there anything wrong with you with me nothing said he these two beings who had loved each other so exclusively and with so touching an affection and who had lived so long for each other now suffered side by side each on the other s account without acknowledging it to each other without anger towards each other and with a smile chapter viii the chain gang jean valjean was the more unhappy of the two youth even in its sorrows always possesses its own peculiar radiance at times jean valjean suffered so greatly that he became puerile it is the property of grief to cause the childish side of man to reappear he had an unconquerable conviction that cosette was escaping from him he would have liked to resist to retain her to arouse her enthusiasm by some external and brilliant matter these ideas puerile as we have just said and at the same time senile conveyed to him by their very childishness a tolerably just notion of the influence of gold lace on the imaginations of young girls he once chanced to see a general on horseback in full uniform pass along the street comte coutard the commandant of paris he envied that gilded man what happiness it would be he said to himself if he could put on that suit which was an incontestable thing and if cosette could behold him thus she would be dazzled and when he had cosette on his arm and passed the gates of the tuileries the guard would present arms to him and that would suffice for cosette and would dispel her idea of looking at young men an unforeseen shock was added to these sad reflections in the isolated life which they led and since they had come to dwell in the rue plumet they had contracted one habit they sometimes took a pleasure trip to see the sun rise a mild species of enjoyment which befits those who are entering life and those who are quitting it for those who love solitude a walk in the early morning is equivalent to a stroll by night with the cheerfulness of nature added the streets are deserted and the birds are singing cosette a bird herself liked to rise early these matutinal excursions were planned on the preceding evening he proposed and she agreed it was arranged like a plot they set out before daybreak and these trips were so many small delights for cosette these innocent eccentricities please young people jean valjean s inclination led him as we have seen to the least frequented spots to solitary nooks to forgotten places there then existed in the vicinity of the barriers of paris a sort of poor meadows which were almost confounded with the city where grew in summer sickly grain and which in autumn after the harvest had been gathered presented the appearance not of having been reaped but peeled jean valjean loved to haunt these fields cosette was not bored there it meant solitude to him and liberty to her there she became a little girl once more she could run and almost play she took off her hat laid it on jean valjean s knees and gathered bunches of flowers she gazed at the butterflies on the flowers but did not catch them gentleness and tenderness are born with love and the young girl who cherishes within her breast a trembling and fragile ideal has mercy on the wing of a butterfly she wove garlands of poppies which she placed on her head and which crossed and penetrated with sunlight glowing until they flamed formed for her rosy face a crown of burning embers even after their life had grown sad they kept up their custom of early strolls one morning in october therefore tempted by the serene perfection of the autumn of 1831 they set out and found themselves at break of day near the barrière du maine it was not dawn it was daybreak a delightful and stern moment a few constellations here and there in the deep pale azure the earth all black the heavens all white a quiver amid the blades of grass everywhere the mysterious chill of twilight a lark which seemed mingled with the stars was carolling at a prodigious height and one would have declared that that hymn of pettiness calmed immensity in the east the val de grâce projected its dark mass on the clear horizon with the sharpness of steel venus dazzlingly brilliant was rising behind that dome and had the air of a soul making its escape from a gloomy edifice all was peace and silence there was no one on the road a few stray laborers of whom they caught barely a glimpse were on their way to their work along the side paths jean valjean was sitting in a cross walk on some planks deposited at the gate of a timber yard his face was turned towards the highway his back towards the light he had forgotten the sun which was on the point of rising he had sunk into one of those profound absorptions in which the mind becomes concentrated which imprison even the eye and which are equivalent to four walls there are meditations which may be called vertical when one is at the bottom of them time is required to return to earth jean valjean had plunged into one of these reveries he was thinking of cosette of the happiness that was possible if nothing came between him and her of the light with which she filled his life a light which was but the emanation of her soul he was almost happy in his revery cosette who was standing beside him was gazing at the clouds as they turned rosy all at once cosette exclaimed father i should think some one was coming yonder jean valjean raised his eyes cosette was right the causeway which leads to the ancient barrière du maine is a prolongation as the reader knows of the rue de sèvres and is cut at right angles by the inner boulevard at the elbow of the causeway and the boulevard at the spot where it branches they heard a noise which it was difficult to account for at that hour and a sort of confused pile made its appearance some shapeless thing which was coming from the boulevard was turning into the road it grew larger it seemed to move in an orderly manner though it was bristling and quivering it seemed to be a vehicle but its load could not be distinctly made out there were horses wheels shouts whips were cracking by degrees the outlines became fixed although bathed in shadows it was a vehicle in fact which had just turned from the boulevard into the highway and which was directing its course towards the barrier near which sat jean valjean a second of the same aspect followed then a third then a fourth seven chariots made their appearance in succession the heads of the horses touching the rear of the wagon in front figures were moving on these vehicles flashes were visible through the dusk as though there were naked swords there a clanking became audible which resembled the rattling of chains and as this something advanced the sound of voices waxed louder and it turned into a terrible thing such as emerges from the cave of dreams as it drew nearer it assumed a form and was outlined behind the trees with the pallid hue of an apparition the mass grew white the day which was slowly dawning cast a wan light on this swarming heap which was at once both sepulchral and living the heads of the figures turned into the faces of corpses and this is what it proved to be seven wagons were driving in a file along the road the first six were singularly constructed they resembled coopers drays they consisted of long ladders placed on two wheels and forming barrows at their rear extremities each dray or rather let us say each ladder was attached to four horses harnessed tandem on these ladders strange clusters of men were being drawn in the faint light these men were to be divined rather than seen twenty four on each vehicle twelve on a side back to back facing the passers by their legs dangling in the air this was the manner in which these men were travelling and behind their backs they had something which clanked and which was a chain and on their necks something which shone and which was an iron collar each man had his collar but the chain was for all so that if these four and twenty men had occasion to alight from the dray and walk they were seized with a sort of inexorable unity and were obliged to wind over the ground with the chain for a backbone somewhat after the fashion of millepeds in the back and front of each vehicle two men armed with muskets stood erect each holding one end of the chain under his foot the iron necklets were square the seventh vehicle a huge rack sided baggage wagon without a hood had four wheels and six horses and carried a sonorous pile of iron boilers cast iron pots braziers and chains among which were mingled several men who were pinioned and stretched at full length and who seemed to be ill this wagon all lattice work was garnished with dilapidated hurdles which appeared to have served for former punishments these vehicles kept to the middle of the road on each side marched a double hedge of guards of infamous aspect wearing three cornered hats like the soldiers under the directory shabby covered with spots and holes muffled in uniforms of veterans and the trousers of undertakers men half gray half blue which were almost hanging in rags with red epaulets yellow shoulder belts short sabres muskets and cudgels they were a species of soldier blackguards these myrmidons seemed composed of the abjectness of the beggar and the authority of the executioner the one who appeared to be their chief held a postilion s whip in his hand all these details blurred by the dimness of dawn became more and more clearly outlined as the light increased at the head and in the rear of the convoy rode mounted gendarmes serious and with sword in fist this procession was so long that when the first vehicle reached the barrier the last was barely debauching from the boulevard a throng sprung it is impossible to say whence and formed in a twinkling as is frequently the case in paris pressed forward from both sides of the road and looked on in the neighboring lanes the shouts of people calling to each other and the wooden shoes of market gardeners hastening up to gaze were audible the men massed upon the drays allowed themselves to be jolted along in silence they were livid with the chill of morning they all wore linen trousers and their bare feet were thrust into wooden shoes the rest of their costume was a fantasy of wretchedness their accoutrements were horribly incongruous nothing is more funereal than the harlequin in rags battered felt hats tarpaulin caps hideous woollen nightcaps and side by side with a short blouse a black coat broken at the elbow many wore women s headgear others had baskets on their heads hairy breasts were visible and through the rent in their garments tattooed designs could be descried temples of love flaming hearts cupids eruptions and unhealthy red blotches could also be seen two or three had a straw rope attached to the cross bar of the dray and suspended under them like a stirrup which supported their feet one of them held in his hand and raised to his mouth something which had the appearance of a black stone and which he seemed to be gnawing it was bread which he was eating there were no eyes there which were not either dry dulled or flaming with an evil light the escort troop cursed the men in chains did not utter a syllable from time to time the sound of a blow became audible as the cudgels descended on shoulder blades or skulls some of these men were yawning their rags were terrible their feet hung down their shoulders oscillated their heads clashed together their fetters clanked their eyes glared ferociously their fists clenched or fell open inertly like the hands of corpses in the rear of the convoy ran a band of children screaming with laughter this file of vehicles whatever its nature was was mournful it was evident that to morrow that an hour hence a pouring rain might descend that it might be followed by another and another and that their dilapidated garments would be drenched that once soaked these men would not get dry again that once chilled they would not again get warm that their linen trousers would be glued to their bones by the downpour that the water would fill their shoes that no lashes from the whips would be able to prevent their jaws from chattering that the chain would continue to bind them by the neck that their legs would continue to dangle and it was impossible not to shudder at the sight of these human beings thus bound and passive beneath the cold clouds of autumn and delivered over to the rain to the blast to all the furies of the air like trees and stones blows from the cudgel were not omitted even in the case of the sick men who lay there knotted with ropes and motionless on the seventh wagon and who appeared to have been tossed there like sacks filled with misery suddenly the sun made its appearance the immense light of the orient burst forth and one would have said that it had set fire to all those ferocious heads their tongues were unloosed a conflagration of grins oaths and songs exploded the broad horizontal sheet of light severed the file in two parts illuminating heads and bodies leaving feet and wheels in the obscurity thoughts made their appearance on these faces it was a terrible moment visible demons with their masks removed fierce souls laid bare though lighted up this wild throng remained in gloom some who were gay had in their mouths quills through which they blew vermin over the crowd picking out the women the dawn accentuated these lamentable profiles with the blackness of its shadows there was not one of these creatures who was not deformed by reason of wretchedness and the whole was so monstrous that one would have said that the sun s brilliancy had been changed into the glare of the lightning the wagon load which headed the line had struck up a song and were shouting at the top of their voices with a haggard joviality a pot pourri by desaugiers then famous called the vestal the trees shivered mournfully in the cross lanes countenances of bourgeois listened in an idiotic delight to these coarse strains droned by spectres all sorts of distress met in this procession as in chaos here were to be found the facial angles of every sort of beast old men youths bald heads gray beards cynical monstrosities sour resignation savage grins senseless attitudes snouts surmounted by caps heads like those of young girls with corkscrew curls on the temples infantile visages and by reason of that horrible thin skeleton faces to which death alone was lacking on the first cart was a negro who had been a slave in all probability and who could make a comparison of his chains the frightful leveller from below shame had passed over these brows at that degree of abasement the last transformations were suffered by all in their extremest depths and ignorance converted into dulness was the equal of intelligence converted into despair there was no choice possible between these men who appeared to the eye as the flower of the mud it was evident that the person who had had the ordering of that unclean procession had not classified them these beings had been fettered and coupled pell mell in alphabetical disorder probably and loaded hap hazard on those carts nevertheless horrors when grouped together always end by evolving a result all additions of wretched men give a sum total each chain exhaled a common soul and each dray load had its own physiognomy by the side of the one where they were singing there was one where they were howling a third where they were begging one could be seen in which they were gnashing their teeth another load menaced the spectators another blasphemed god the last was as silent as the tomb dante would have thought that he beheld his seven circles of hell on the march the march of the damned to their tortures performed in sinister wise not on the formidable and flaming chariot of the apocalypse but what was more mournful than that on the gibbet cart one of the guards who had a hook on the end of his cudgel made a pretence from time to time of stirring up this mass of human filth an old woman in the crowd pointed them out to her little boy five years old and said to him rascal let that be a warning to you as the songs and blasphemies increased the man who appeared to be the captain of the escort cracked his whip and at that signal a fearful dull and blind flogging which produced the sound of hail fell upon the seven dray loads many roared and foamed at the mouth which redoubled the delight of the street urchins who had hastened up a swarm of flies on these wounds jean valjean s eyes had assumed a frightful expression they were no longer eyes they were those deep and glassy objects which replace the glance in the case of certain wretched men which seem unconscious of reality and in which flames the reflection of terrors and of catastrophes he was not looking at a spectacle he was seeing a vision he tried to rise to flee to make his escape he could not move his feet sometimes the things that you see seize upon you and hold you fast he remained nailed to the spot petrified stupid asking himself athwart confused and inexpressible anguish what this sepulchral persecution signified and whence had come that pandemonium which was pursuing him all at once he raised his hand to his brow a gesture habitual to those whose memory suddenly returns he remembered that this was in fact the usual itinerary that it was customary to make this detour in order to avoid all possibility of encountering royalty on the road to fontainebleau and that five and thirty years before he had himself passed through that barrier cosette was no less terrified but in a different way she did not understand what she beheld did not seem to her to be possible at length she cried father what are those men in those carts jean valjean replied convicts whither are they going to the galleys at that moment the cudgelling multiplied by a hundred hands became zealous blows with the flat of the sword were mingled with it it was a perfect storm of whips and clubs the convicts bent before it a hideous obedience was evoked by the torture and all held their peace darting glances like chained wolves cosette trembled in every limb she resumed father are they still men sometimes answered the unhappy man it was the chain gang in fact which had set out before daybreak from bicêtre and had taken the road to mans in order to avoid fontainebleau where the king then was this caused the horrible journey to last three or four days longer but torture may surely be prolonged with the object of sparing the royal personage a sight of it jean valjean returned home utterly overwhelmed such encounters are shocks and the memory that they leave behind them resembles a thorough shaking up nevertheless jean valjean did not observe that on his way back to the rue de babylone with cosette the latter was plying him with other questions on the subject of what they had just seen perhaps he was too much absorbed in his own dejection to notice her words and reply to them but when cosette was leaving him in the evening to betake herself to bed he heard her say in a low voice and as though talking to herself it seems to me that if i were to find one of those men in my pathway oh my god i should die merely from the sight of him close at hand fortunately chance ordained that on the morrow of that tragic day there was some official solemnity apropos of i know not what fêtes in paris a review in the champ de mars jousts on the seine theatrical performances in the champs élysées fireworks at the arc de l étoile illuminations everywhere jean valjean did violence to his habits and took cosette to see these rejoicings for the purpose of diverting her from the memory of the day before and of effacing beneath the smiling tumult of all paris the abominable thing which had passed before her the review with which the festival was spiced made the presence of uniforms perfectly natural jean valjean donned his uniform of a national guard with the vague inward feeling of a man who is betaking himself to shelter however this trip seemed to attain its object cosette who made it her law to please her father and to whom moreover all spectacles were a novelty accepted this diversion with the light and easy good grace of youth and did not pout too disdainfully at that flutter of enjoyment called a public fête so that jean valjean was able to believe that he had succeeded and that no trace of that hideous vision remained some days later one morning when the sun was shining brightly and they were both on the steps leading to the garden another infraction of the rules which jean valjean seemed to have imposed upon himself and to the custom of remaining in her chamber which melancholy had caused cosette to adopt cosette in a wrapper was standing erect in that negligent attire of early morning which envelops young girls in an adorable way and which produces the effect of a cloud drawn over a star and with her head bathed in light rosy after a good sleep submitting to the gentle glances of the tender old man she was picking a daisy to pieces cosette did not know the delightful legend i love a little passionately etc who was there who could have taught her she was handling the flower instinctively innocently without a suspicion that to pluck a daisy apart is to do the same by a heart if there were a fourth and smiling grace called melancholy she would have worn the air of that grace jean valjean was fascinated by the contemplation of those tiny fingers on that flower and forgetful of everything in the radiance emitted by that child a red breast was warbling in the thicket on one side white cloudlets floated across the sky so gayly that one would have said that they had just been set at liberty cosette went on attentively tearing the leaves from her flower she seemed to be thinking about something but whatever it was it must be something charming all at once she turned her head over her shoulder with the delicate languor of a swan and said to jean valjean father what are the galleys like book fourth succor from below may turn out to be succor from on high chapter i a wound without healing within thus their life clouded over by degrees but one diversion which had formerly been a happiness remained to them which was to carry bread to those who were hungry and clothing to those who were cold cosette often accompanied jean valjean on these visits to the poor on which they recovered some remnants of their former free intercourse and sometimes when the day had been a good one and they had assisted many in distress and cheered and warmed many little children cosette was rather merry in the evening it was at this epoch that they paid their visit to the jondrette den on the day following that visit jean valjean made his appearance in the pavilion in the morning calm as was his wont but with a large wound on his left arm which was much inflamed and very angry which resembled a burn and which he explained in some way or other this wound resulted in his being detained in the house for a month with fever he would not call in a doctor when cosette urged him call the dog doctor said he cosette dressed the wound morning and evening with so divine an air and such angelic happiness at being of use to him that jean valjean felt all his former joy returning his fears and anxieties dissipating and he gazed at cosette saying oh what a kindly wound oh what a good misfortune cosette on perceiving that her father was ill had deserted the pavilion and again taken a fancy to the little lodging and the back courtyard she passed nearly all her days beside jean valjean and read to him the books which he desired generally they were books of travel jean valjean was undergoing a new birth his happiness was reviving in these ineffable rays the luxembourg the prowling young stranger cosette s coldness all these clouds upon his soul were growing dim he had reached the point where he said to himself i imagined all that i am an old fool his happiness was so great that the horrible discovery of the thénardiers made in the jondrette hovel unexpected as it was had after a fashion glided over him unnoticed he had succeeded in making his escape all trace of him was lost what more did he care for he only thought of those wretched beings to pity them here they are in prison and henceforth they will be incapacitated for doing any harm he thought but what a lamentable family in distress as for the hideous vision of the barrière du maine cosette had not referred to it again sister sainte mechtilde had taught cosette music in the convent cosette had the voice of a linnet with a soul and sometimes in the evening in the wounded man s humble abode she warbled melancholy songs which delighted jean valjean spring came the garden was so delightful at that season of the year that jean valjean said to cosette you never go there i want you to stroll in it as you like father said cosette and for the sake of obeying her father she resumed her walks in the garden generally alone for as we have mentioned jean valjean who was probably afraid of being seen through the fence hardly ever went there jean valjean s wound had created a diversion when cosette saw that her father was suffering less that he was convalescing and that he appeared to be happy she experienced a contentment which she did not even perceive so gently and naturally had it come then it was in the month of march the days were growing longer the winter was departing the winter always bears away with it a portion of our sadness then came april that daybreak of summer fresh as dawn always is gay like every childhood a little inclined to weep at times like the new born being that it is in that month nature has charming gleams which pass from the sky from the trees from the meadows and the flowers into the heart of man cosette was still too young to escape the penetrating influence of that april joy which bore so strong a resemblance to herself insensibly and without her suspecting the fact the blackness departed from her spirit in spring sad souls grow light as light falls into cellars at midday cosette was no longer sad however though this was so she did not account for it to herself in the morning about ten o clock after breakfast when she had succeeded in enticing her father into the garden for a quarter of an hour and when she was pacing up and down in the sunlight in front of the steps supporting his left arm for him she did not perceive that she laughed every moment and that she was happy jean valjean intoxicated beheld her growing fresh and rosy once more oh what a good wound he repeated in a whisper and he felt grateful to the thénardiers his wound once healed he resumed his solitary twilight strolls it is a mistake to suppose that a person can stroll alone in that fashion in the uninhabited regions of paris without meeting with some adventure chapter ii mother plutarque finds no difficulty in explaining a phenomenon one evening little gavroche had had nothing to eat he remembered that he had not dined on the preceding day either this was becoming tiresome he resolved to make an effort to secure some supper he strolled out beyond the salpêtrière into deserted regions that is where windfalls are to be found where there is no one one always finds something he reached a settlement which appeared to him to be the village of austerlitz in one of his preceding lounges he had noticed there an old garden haunted by an old man and an old woman and in that garden a passable apple tree beside the apple tree stood a sort of fruit house which was not securely fastened and where one might contrive to get an apple one apple is a supper one apple is life that which was adam s ruin might prove gavroche s salvation the garden abutted on a solitary unpaved lane bordered with brushwood while awaiting the arrival of houses the garden was separated from it by a hedge gavroche directed his steps towards this garden he found the lane he recognized the apple tree he verified the fruit house he examined the hedge a hedge means merely one stride the day was declining there was not even a cat in the lane the hour was propitious gavroche began the operation of scaling the hedge then suddenly paused some one was talking in the garden gavroche peeped through one of the breaks in the hedge enlarge a couple of paces distant at the foot of the hedge on the other side exactly at the point where the gap which he was meditating would have been made there was a sort of recumbent stone which formed a bench and on this bench was seated the old man of the garden while the old woman was standing in front of him the old woman was grumbling gavroche who was not very discreet listened monsieur mabeuf said the old woman mabeuf thought gavroche that name is a perfect farce the old man who was thus addressed did not stir the old woman repeated monsieur mabeuf the old man without raising his eyes from the ground made up his mind to answer what is it mother plutarque mother plutarque thought gavroche another farcical name mother plutarque began again and the old man was forced to accept the conversation the landlord is not pleased why we owe three quarters rent in three months we shall owe him for four quarters he says that he will turn you out to sleep i will go the green grocer insists on being paid she will no longer leave her fagots what will you warm yourself with this winter we shall have no wood there is the sun the butcher refuses to give credit he will not let us have any more meat that is quite right i do not digest meat well it is too heavy what shall we have for dinner bread the baker demands a settlement and says no money no bread that is well what will you eat we have apples in the apple room but monsieur we can t live like that without money i have none the old woman went away the old man remained alone he fell into thought gavroche became thoughtful also it was almost dark the first result of gavroche s meditation was that instead of scaling the hedge he crouched down under it the branches stood apart a little at the foot of the thicket come exclaimed gavroche mentally here s a nook and he curled up in it his back was almost in contact with father mabeuf s bench he could hear the octogenarian breathe then by way of dinner he tried to sleep it was a cat nap with one eye open while he dozed gavroche kept on the watch the twilight pallor of the sky blanched the earth and the lane formed a livid line between two rows of dark bushes all at once in this whitish band two figures made their appearance one was in front the other some distance in the rear there come two creatures muttered gavroche the first form seemed to be some elderly bourgeois who was bent and thoughtful dressed more than plainly and who was walking slowly because of his age and strolling about in the open evening air the second was straight firm slender it regulated its pace by that of the first but in the voluntary slowness of its gait suppleness and agility were discernible this figure had also something fierce and disquieting about it the whole shape was that of what was then called an elegant the hat was of good shape the coat black well cut probably of fine cloth and well fitted in at the waist the head was held erect with a sort of robust grace and beneath the hat the pale profile of a young man could be made out in the dim light the profile had a rose in its mouth this second form was well known to gavroche it was montparnasse he could have told nothing about the other except that he was a respectable old man gavroche immediately began to take observations one of these two pedestrians evidently had a project connected with the other gavroche was well placed to watch the course of events the bedroom had turned into a hiding place at a very opportune moment montparnasse on the hunt at such an hour in such a place betokened something threatening gavroche felt his gamin s heart moved with compassion for the old man what was he to do interfere one weakness coming to the aid of another it would be merely a laughing matter for montparnasse gavroche did not shut his eyes to the fact that the old man in the first place and the child in the second would make but two mouthfuls for that redoubtable ruffian eighteen years of age while gavroche was deliberating the attack took place abruptly and hideously the attack of the tiger on the wild ass the attack of the spider on the fly montparnasse suddenly tossed away his rose bounded upon the old man seized him by the collar grasped and clung to him and gavroche with difficulty restrained a scream a moment later one of these men was underneath the other groaning struggling with a knee of marble upon his breast only it was not just what gavroche had expected the one who lay on the earth was montparnasse the one who was on top was the old man all this took place a few paces distant from gavroche the old man had received the shock had returned it and that in such a terrible fashion that in a twinkling the assailant and the assailed had exchanged rôles here s a hearty veteran thought gavroche he could not refrain from clapping his hands but it was applause wasted it did not reach the combatants absorbed and deafened as they were each by the other as their breath mingled in the struggle silence ensued montparnasse ceased his struggles gavroche indulged in this aside can he be dead the goodman had not uttered a word nor given vent to a cry he rose to his feet and gavroche heard him say to montparnasse get up montparnasse rose but the goodman held him fast montparnasse s attitude was the humiliated and furious attitude of the wolf who has been caught by a sheep gavroche looked on and listened making an effort to reinforce his eyes with his ears he was enjoying himself immensely he was repaid for his conscientious anxiety in the character of a spectator he was able to catch on the wing a dialogue which borrowed from the darkness an indescribably tragic accent the goodman questioned montparnasse replied how old are you nineteen you are strong and healthy why do you not work it bores me what is your trade an idler speak seriously can anything be done for you what would you like to be a thief a pause ensued the old man seemed absorbed in profound thought he stood motionless and did not relax his hold on montparnasse every moment the vigorous and agile young ruffian indulged in the twitchings of a wild beast caught in a snare he gave a jerk tried a crook of the knee twisted his limbs desperately and made efforts to escape the old man did not appear to notice it and held both his arms with one hand with the sovereign indifference of absolute force the old man s revery lasted for some time then looking steadily at montparnasse he addressed to him in a gentle voice in the midst of the darkness where they stood a solemn harangue of which gavroche did not lose a single syllable my child you are entering through indolence on one of the most laborious of lives ah you declare yourself to be an idler prepare to toil there is a certain formidable machine have you seen it it is the rolling mill you must be on your guard against it it is crafty and ferocious if it catches hold of the skirt of your coat you will be drawn in bodily that machine is laziness stop while there is yet time and save yourself otherwise it is all over with you in a short time you will be among the gearing once entangled hope for nothing more toil lazybones there is no more repose for you the iron hand of implacable toil has seized you you do not wish to earn your living to have a task to fulfil a duty it bores you to be like other men well you will be different labor is the law he who rejects it will find ennui his torment you do not wish to be a workingman you will be a slave toil lets go of you on one side only to grasp you again on the other you do not desire to be its friend you shall be its negro slave ah you would have none of the honest weariness of men you shall have the sweat of the damned where others sing you will rattle in your throat you will see afar off from below other men at work it will seem to you that they are resting the laborer the harvester the sailor the blacksmith will appear to you in glory like the blessed spirits in paradise what radiance surrounds the forge to guide the plough to bind the sheaves is joy the bark at liberty in the wind what delight do you lazy idler delve drag on roll march drag your halter you are a beast of burden in the team of hell ah to do nothing is your object well not a week not a day not an hour shall you have free from oppression you will be able to lift nothing without anguish every minute that passes will make your muscles crack what is a feather to others will be a rock to you the simplest things will become steep acclivities life will become monstrous all about you to go to come to breathe will be just so many terrible labors your lungs will produce on you the effect of weighing a hundred pounds whether you shall walk here rather than there will become a problem that must be solved any one who wants to go out simply gives his door a push and there he is in the open air if you wish to go out you will be obliged to pierce your wall what does every one who wants to step into the street do he goes down stairs you will tear up your sheets little by little you will make of them a rope then you will climb out of your window and you will suspend yourself by that thread over an abyss and it will be night amid storm rain and the hurricane and if the rope is too short but one way of descending will remain to you to fall to drop hap hazard into the gulf from an unknown height on what on what is beneath on the unknown or you will crawl up a chimney flue at the risk of burning or you will creep through a sewer pipe at the risk of drowning i do not speak of the holes that you will be obliged to mask of the stones which you will have to take up and replace twenty times a day of the plaster that you will have to hide in your straw pallet a lock presents itself the bourgeois has in his pocket a key made by a locksmith if you wish to pass out you will be condemned to execute a terrible work of art you will take a large sou you will cut it in two plates with what tools you will have to invent them that is your business then you will hollow out the interior of these plates taking great care of the outside and you will make on the edges a thread so that they can be adjusted one upon the other like a box and its cover the top and bottom thus screwed together nothing will be suspected to the overseers it will be only a sou to you it will be a box what will you put in this box a small bit of steel a watch spring in which you will have cut teeth and which will form a saw with this saw as long as a pin and concealed in a sou you will cut the bolt of the lock you will sever bolts the padlock of your chain and the bar at your window and the fetter on your leg this masterpiece finished this prodigy accomplished all these miracles of art address skill and patience executed what will be your recompense if it becomes known that you are the author the dungeon there is your future what precipices are idleness and pleasure do you know that to do nothing is a melancholy resolution to live in idleness on the property of society to be useless that is to say pernicious this leads straight to the depth of wretchedness woe to the man who desires to be a parasite he will become vermin ah so it does not please you to work ah you have but one thought to drink well to eat well to sleep well you will drink water you will eat black bread you will sleep on a plank with a fetter whose cold touch you will feel on your flesh all night long riveted to your limbs you will break those fetters you will flee that is well you will crawl on your belly through the brushwood and you will eat grass like the beasts of the forest and you will be recaptured and then you will pass years in a dungeon riveted to a wall groping for your jug that you may drink gnawing at a horrible loaf of darkness which dogs would not touch eating beans that the worms have eaten before you you will be a wood louse in a cellar ah have pity on yourself you miserable young child who were sucking at nurse less than twenty years ago and who have no doubt a mother still alive i conjure you listen to me i entreat you you desire fine black cloth varnished shoes to have your hair curled and sweet smelling oils on your locks to please low women to be handsome you will be shaven clean and you will wear a red blouse and wooden shoes you want rings on your fingers you will have an iron necklet on your neck if you glance at a woman you will receive a blow and you will enter there at the age of twenty and you will come out at fifty you will enter young rosy fresh with brilliant eyes and all your white teeth and your handsome youthful hair you will come out broken bent wrinkled toothless horrible with white locks ah my poor child you are on the wrong road idleness is counselling you badly the hardest of all work is thieving believe me do not undertake that painful profession of an idle man it is not comfortable to become a rascal it is less disagreeable to be an honest man now go and ponder on what i have said to you by the way what did you want of me my purse here it is and the old man releasing montparnasse put his purse in the latter s hand montparnasse weighed it for a moment after which he allowed it to slide gently into the back pocket of his coat with the same mechanical precaution as though he had stolen it all this having been said and done the goodman turned his back and tranquilly resumed his stroll the blockhead muttered montparnasse who was this goodman the reader has no doubt already divined montparnasse watched him with amazement as he disappeared in the dusk this contemplation was fatal to him while the old man was walking away gavroche drew near gavroche had assured himself with a sidelong glance that father mabeuf was still sitting on his bench probably sound asleep then the gamin emerged from his thicket and began to crawl after montparnasse in the dark as the latter stood there motionless in this manner he came up to montparnasse without being seen or heard gently insinuated his hand into the back pocket of that frock coat of fine black cloth seized the purse withdrew his hand and having recourse once more to his crawling he slipped away like an adder through the shadows montparnasse who had no reason to be on his guard and who was engaged in thought for the first time in his life perceived nothing when gavroche had once more attained the point where father mabeuf was he flung the purse over the hedge and fled as fast as his legs would carry him the purse fell on father mabeuf s foot this commotion roused him he bent over and picked up the purse he did not understand in the least and opened it the purse had two compartments in one of them there was some small change in the other lay six napoleons m mabeuf in great alarm referred the matter to his housekeeper that has fallen from heaven said mother plutarque book fifth the end of which does not resemble the beginning chapter i solitude and the barracks combined cosette s grief which had been so poignant and lively four or five months previously had without her being conscious of the fact entered upon its convalescence nature spring youth love for her father the gayety of the birds and flowers caused something almost resembling forgetfulness to filter gradually drop by drop into that soul which was so virgin and so young was the fire wholly extinct there or was it merely that layers of ashes had formed the truth is that she hardly felt the painful and burning spot any longer one day she suddenly thought of marius why said she i no longer think of him that same week she noticed a very handsome officer of lancers with a wasp like waist a delicious uniform the cheeks of a young girl a sword under his arm waxed mustaches and a glazed schapka passing the gate moreover he had light hair prominent blue eyes a round face was vain insolent and good looking quite the reverse of marius he had a cigar in his mouth cosette thought that this officer doubtless belonged to the regiment in barracks in the rue de babylone on the following day she saw him pass again she took note of the hour from that time forth was it chance she saw him pass nearly every day the officer s comrades perceived that there was in that badly kept garden behind that malicious rococo fence a very pretty creature who was almost always there when the handsome lieutenant who is not unknown to the reader and whose name was théodule gillenormand passed by see here they said to him there s a little creature there who is making eyes at you look have i the time replied the lancer to look at all the girls who look at me this was at the precise moment when marius was descending heavily towards agony and was saying if i could but see her before i die had his wish been realized had he beheld cosette at that moment gazing at the lancer he would not have been able to utter a word and he would have expired with grief whose fault was it no one s marius possessed one of those temperaments which bury themselves in sorrow and there abide cosette was one of those persons who plunge into sorrow and emerge from it again cosette was moreover passing through that dangerous period the fatal phase of feminine revery abandoned to itself in which the isolated heart of a young girl resembles the tendrils of the vine which cling as chance directs to the capital of a marble column or to the post of a wine shop a rapid and decisive moment critical for every orphan be she rich or poor for wealth does not prevent a bad choice misalliances are made in very high circles real misalliance is that of souls and as many an unknown young man without name without birth without fortune is a marble column which bears up a temple of grand sentiments and grand ideas so such and such a man of the world satisfied and opulent who has polished boots and varnished words if looked at not outside but inside a thing which is reserved for his wife is nothing more than a block obscurely haunted by violent unclean and vinous passions the post of a drinking shop what did cosette s soul contain passion calmed or lulled to sleep something limpid brilliant troubled to a certain depth and gloomy lower down the image of the handsome officer was reflected in the surface did a souvenir linger in the depths quite at the bottom possibly cosette did not know a singular incident supervened chapter ii cosette s apprehensions during the first fortnight in april jean valjean took a journey this as the reader knows happened from time to time at very long intervals he remained absent a day or two days at the utmost where did he go no one knew not even cosette once only on the occasion of one of these departures she had accompanied him in a hackney coach as far as a little blind alley at the corner of which she read impasse de la planchette there he alighted and the coach took cosette back to the rue de babylone it was usually when money was lacking in the house that jean valjean took these little trips so jean valjean was absent he had said i shall return in three days that evening cosette was alone in the drawing room in order to get rid of her ennui she had opened her piano organ and had begun to sing accompanying herself the while the chorus from euryanthe hunters astray in the wood which is probably the most beautiful thing in all the sphere of music when she had finished she remained wrapped in thought all at once it seemed to her that she heard the sound of footsteps in the garden it could not be her father he was absent it could not be toussaint she was in bed and it was ten o clock at night she stepped to the shutter of the drawing room which was closed and laid her ear against it it seemed to her that it was the tread of a man and that he was walking very softly she mounted rapidly to the first floor to her own chamber opened a small wicket in her shutter and peeped into the garden the moon was at the full everything could be seen as plainly as by day there was no one there she opened the window the garden was absolutely calm and all that was visible was that the street was deserted as usual cosette thought that she had been mistaken she thought that she had heard a noise it was a hallucination produced by the melancholy and magnificent chorus of weber which lays open before the mind terrified depths which trembles before the gaze like a dizzy forest and in which one hears the crackling of dead branches beneath the uneasy tread of the huntsmen of whom one catches a glimpse through the twilight she thought no more about it moreover cosette was not very timid by nature there flowed in her veins some of the blood of the bohemian and the adventuress who runs barefoot it will be remembered that she was more of a lark than a dove there was a foundation of wildness and bravery in her on the following day at an earlier hour towards nightfall she was strolling in the garden in the midst of the confused thoughts which occupied her she fancied that she caught for an instant a sound similar to that of the preceding evening as though some one were walking beneath the trees in the dusk and not very far from her but she told herself that nothing so closely resembles a step on the grass as the friction of two branches which have moved from side to side and she paid no heed to it besides she could see nothing she emerged from the thicket she had still to cross a small lawn to regain the steps the moon which had just risen behind her cast cosette s shadow in front of her upon this lawn as she came out from the shrubbery cosette halted in alarm beside her shadow the moon outlined distinctly upon the turf another shadow which was particularly startling and terrible a shadow which had a round hat it was the shadow of a man who must have been standing on the border of the clump of shrubbery a few paces in the rear of cosette she stood for a moment without the power to speak or cry or call or stir or turn her head then she summoned up all her courage and turned round resolutely there was no one there she glanced on the ground the figure had disappeared she re entered the thicket searched the corners boldly went as far as the gate and found nothing she felt herself absolutely chilled with terror was this another hallucination what two days in succession one hallucination might pass but two hallucinations the disquieting point about it was that the shadow had assuredly not been a phantom phantoms do not wear round hats on the following day jean valjean returned cosette told him what she thought she had heard and seen she wanted to be reassured and to see her father shrug his shoulders and say to her you are a little goose jean valjean grew anxious it cannot be anything said he he left her under some pretext and went into the garden and she saw him examining the gate with great attention during the night she woke up this time she was sure and she distinctly heard some one walking close to the flight of steps beneath her window she ran to her little wicket and opened it in point of fact there was a man in the garden with a large club in his hand just as she was about to scream the moon lighted up the man s profile it was her father she returned to her bed saying to herself he is very uneasy jean valjean passed that night and the two succeeding nights in the garden cosette saw him through the hole in her shutter on the third night the moon was on the wane and had begun to rise later at one o clock in the morning possibly she heard a loud burst of laughter and her father s voice calling her cosette she jumped out of bed threw on her dressing gown and opened her window her father was standing on the grass plot below i have waked you for the purpose of reassuring you said he look there is your shadow with the round hat and he pointed out to her on the turf a shadow cast by the moon and which did indeed bear considerable resemblance to the spectre of a man wearing a round hat it was the shadow produced by a chimney pipe of sheet iron with a hood which rose above a neighboring roof cosette joined in his laughter all her lugubrious suppositions were allayed and the next morning as she was at breakfast with her father she made merry over the sinister garden haunted by the shadows of iron chimney pots jean valjean became quite tranquil once more as for cosette she did not pay much attention to the question whether the chimney pot was really in the direction of the shadow which she had seen or thought she had seen and whether the moon had been in the same spot in the sky she did not question herself as to the peculiarity of a chimney pot which is afraid of being caught in the act and which retires when some one looks at its shadow for the shadow had taken the alarm when cosette had turned round and cosette had thought herself very sure of this cosette s serenity was fully restored the proof appeared to her to be complete and it quite vanished from her mind whether there could possibly be any one walking in the garden during the evening or at night a few days later however a fresh incident occurred chapter iii enriched with commentaries by toussaint in the garden near the railing on the street there was a stone bench screened from the eyes of the curious by a plantation of yoke elms but which could in case of necessity be reached by an arm from the outside past the trees and the gate one evening during that same month of april jean valjean had gone out cosette had seated herself on this bench after sundown the breeze was blowing briskly in the trees cosette was meditating an objectless sadness was taking possession of her little by little that invincible sadness evoked by the evening and which arises perhaps who knows from the mystery of the tomb which is ajar at that hour perhaps fantine was within that shadow cosette rose slowly made the tour of the garden walking on the grass drenched in dew and saying to herself through the species of melancholy somnambulism in which she was plunged really one needs wooden shoes for the garden at this hour one takes cold she returned to the bench as she was about to resume her seat there she observed on the spot which she had quitted a tolerably large stone which had evidently not been there a moment before cosette gazed at the stone asking herself what it meant all at once the idea occurred to her that the stone had not reached the bench all by itself that some one had placed it there that an arm had been thrust through the railing and this idea appeared to alarm her this time the fear was genuine the stone was there no doubt was possible she did not touch it fled without glancing behind her took refuge in the house and immediately closed with shutter bolt and bar the door like window opening on the flight of steps she inquired of toussaint has my father returned yet not yet mademoiselle we have already noted once for all the fact that toussaint stuttered may we be permitted to dispense with it for the future the musical notation of an infirmity is repugnant to us jean valjean a thoughtful man and given to nocturnal strolls often returned quite late at night toussaint went on cosette are you careful to thoroughly barricade the shutters opening on the garden at least with bars in the evening and to put the little iron things in the little rings that close them oh be easy on that score miss toussaint did not fail in her duty and cosette was well aware of the fact but she could not refrain from adding it is so solitary here so far as that is concerned said toussaint it is true we might be assassinated before we had time to say ouf and monsieur does not sleep in the house to boot but fear nothing miss i fasten the shutters up like prisons lone women that is enough to make one shudder i believe you just imagine what if you were to see men enter your chamber at night and say hold your tongue and begin to cut your throat it s not the dying so much you die for one must die and that s all right it s the abomination of feeling those people touch you and then their knives they can t be able to cut well with them ah good gracious be quiet said cosette fasten everything thoroughly cosette terrified by the melodrama improvised by toussaint and possibly also by the recollection of the apparitions of the past week which recurred to her memory dared not even say to her go and look at the stone which has been placed on the bench for fear of opening the garden gate and allowing the men to enter she saw that all the doors and windows were carefully fastened made toussaint go all over the house from garret to cellar locked herself up in her own chamber bolted her door looked under her couch went to bed and slept badly all night long she saw that big stone as large as a mountain and full of caverns at sunrise the property of the rising sun is to make us laugh at all our terrors of the past night and our laughter is in direct proportion to our terror which they have caused at sunrise cosette when she woke viewed her fright as a nightmare and said to herself what have i been thinking of it is like the footsteps that i thought i heard a week or two ago in the garden at night it is like the shadow of the chimney pot am i becoming a coward the sun which was glowing through the crevices in her shutters and turning the damask curtains crimson reassured her to such an extent that everything vanished from her thoughts even the stone there was no more a stone on the bench than there was a man in a round hat in the garden i dreamed about the stone as i did all the rest she dressed herself descended to the garden ran to the bench and broke out in a cold perspiration the stone was there but this lasted only for a moment that which is terror by night is curiosity by day bah said she come let us see what it is she lifted the stone which was tolerably large beneath it was something which resembled a letter it was a white envelope cosette seized it there was no address on one side no seal on the other yet the envelope though unsealed was not empty papers could be seen inside cosette examined it it was no longer alarm it was no longer curiosity it was a beginning of anxiety cosette drew from the envelope its contents a little notebook of paper each page of which was numbered and bore a few lines in a very fine and rather pretty handwriting as cosette thought cosette looked for a name there was none to whom was this addressed to her probably since a hand had deposited the packet on her bench from whom did it come an irresistible fascination took possession of her she tried to turn away her eyes from the leaflets which were trembling in her hand she gazed at the sky the street the acacias all bathed in light the pigeons fluttering over a neighboring roof and then her glance suddenly fell upon the manuscript and she said to herself that she must know what it contained this is what she read chapter iv a heart beneath a stone enlarge the reduction of the universe to a single being the expansion of a single being even to god that is love love is the salutation of the angels to the stars how sad is the soul when it is sad through love what a void in the absence of the being who by herself alone fills the world oh how true it is that the beloved being becomes god one could comprehend that god might be jealous of this had not god the father of all evidently made creation for the soul and the soul for love the glimpse of a smile beneath a white crape bonnet with a lilac curtain is sufficient to cause the soul to enter into the palace of dreams god is behind everything but everything hides god things are black creatures are opaque to love a being is to render that being transparent certain thoughts are prayers there are moments when whatever the attitude of the body may be the soul is on its knees parted lovers beguile absence by a thousand chimerical devices which possess however a reality of their own they are prevented from seeing each other they cannot write to each other they discover a multitude of mysterious means to correspond they send each other the song of the birds the perfume of the flowers the smiles of children the light of the sun the sighings of the breeze the rays of stars all creation and why not all the works of god are made to serve love love is sufficiently potent to charge all nature with its messages oh spring thou art a letter that i write to her the future belongs to hearts even more than it does to minds love that is the only thing that can occupy and fill eternity in the infinite the inexhaustible is requisite love participates of the soul itself it is of the same nature like it it is the divine spark like it it is incorruptible indivisible imperishable it is a point of fire that exists within us which is immortal and infinite which nothing can confine and which nothing can extinguish we feel it burning even to the very marrow of our bones and we see it beaming in the very depths of heaven oh love adorations voluptuousness of two minds which understand each other of two hearts which exchange with each other of two glances which penetrate each other you will come to me will you not bliss strolls by twos in the solitudes blessed and radiant days i have sometimes dreamed that from time to time hours detached themselves from the lives of the angels and came here below to traverse the destinies of men god can add nothing to the happiness of those who love except to give them endless duration after a life of love an eternity of love is in fact an augmentation but to increase in intensity even the ineffable felicity which love bestows on the soul even in this world is impossible even to god god is the plenitude of heaven love is the plenitude of man you look at a star for two reasons because it is luminous and because it is impenetrable you have beside you a sweeter radiance and a greater mystery woman all of us whoever we may be have our respirable beings we lack air and we stifle then we die to die for lack of love is horrible suffocation of the soul when love has fused and mingled two beings in a sacred and angelic unity the secret of life has been discovered so far as they are concerned they are no longer anything more than the two boundaries of the same destiny they are no longer anything but the two wings of the same spirit love soar on the day when a woman as she passes before you emits light as she walks you are lost you love but one thing remains for you to do to think of her so intently that she is constrained to think of you what love commences can be finished by god alone true love is in despair and is enchanted over a glove lost or a handkerchief found and eternity is required for its devotion and its hopes it is composed both of the infinitely great and the infinitely little if you are a stone be adamant if you are a plant be the sensitive plant if you are a man be love nothing suffices for love we have happiness we desire paradise we possess paradise we desire heaven oh ye who love each other all this is contained in love understand how to find it there love has contemplation as well as heaven and more than heaven it has voluptuousness does she still come to the luxembourg no sir this is the church where she attends mass is it not she no longer comes here does she still live in this house she has moved away where has she gone to dwell she did not say what a melancholy thing not to know the address of one s soul love has its childishness other passions have their pettinesses shame on the passions which belittle man honor to the one which makes a child of him there is one strange thing do you know it i dwell in the night there is a being who carried off my sky when she went away oh would that we were lying side by side in the same grave hand in hand and from time to time in the darkness gently caressing a finger that would suffice for my eternity ye who suffer because ye love love yet more to die of love is to live in it love a sombre and starry transfiguration is mingled with this torture there is ecstasy in agony oh joy of the birds it is because they have nests that they sing love is a celestial respiration of the air of paradise deep hearts sage minds take life as god has made it it is a long trial an incomprehensible preparation for an unknown destiny this destiny the true one begins for a man with the first step inside the tomb then something appears to him and he begins to distinguish the definitive the definitive meditate upon that word the living perceive the infinite the definitive permits itself to be seen only by the dead in the meanwhile love and suffer hope and contemplate woe alas to him who shall have loved only bodies forms appearances death will deprive him of all try to love souls you will find them again i encountered in the street a very poor young man who was in love his hat was old his coat was worn his elbows were in holes water trickled through his shoes and the stars through his soul what a grand thing it is to be loved what a far grander thing it is to love the heart becomes heroic by dint of passion it is no longer composed of anything but what is pure it no longer rests on anything that is not elevated and great an unworthy thought can no more germinate in it than a nettle on a glacier the serene and lofty soul inaccessible to vulgar passions and emotions dominating the clouds and the shades of this world its follies its lies its hatreds its vanities its miseries inhabits the blue of heaven and no longer feels anything but profound and subterranean shocks of destiny as the crests of mountains feel the shocks of earthquake if there did not exist some one who loved the sun would become extinct chapter v cosette after the letter as cosette read she gradually fell into thought at the very moment when she raised her eyes from the last line of the note book the handsome officer passed triumphantly in front of the gate it was his hour cosette thought him hideous she resumed her contemplation of the book it was written in the most charming of chirography thought cosette in the same hand but with divers inks sometimes very black again whitish as when ink has been added to the inkstand and consequently on different days it was then a mind which had unfolded itself there sigh by sigh irregularly without order without choice without object hap hazard cosette had never read anything like it this manuscript in which she already perceived more light than obscurity produced upon her the effect of a half open sanctuary each one of these mysterious lines shone before her eyes and inundated her heart with a strange radiance the education which she had received had always talked to her of the soul and never of love very much as one might talk of the firebrand and not of the flame this manuscript of fifteen pages suddenly and sweetly revealed to her all of love sorrow destiny life eternity the beginning the end it was as if a hand had opened and suddenly flung upon her a handful of rays of light in these few lines she felt a passionate ardent generous honest nature a sacred will an immense sorrow and an immense despair a suffering heart an ecstasy fully expanded what was this manuscript a letter a letter without name without address without date without signature pressing and disinterested an enigma composed of truths a message of love made to be brought by an angel and read by a virgin an appointment made beyond the bounds of earth the love letter of a phantom to a shade it was an absent one tranquil and dejected who seemed ready to take refuge in death and who sent to the absent love his lady the secret of fate the key of life love this had been written with one foot in the grave and one finger in heaven these lines which had fallen one by one on the paper were what might be called drops of soul now from whom could these pages come who could have penned them cosette did not hesitate a moment one man only he day had dawned once more in her spirit all had reappeared she felt an unheard of joy and a profound anguish it was he he who had written he was there it was he whose arm had been thrust through that railing while she was forgetful of him he had found her again but had she forgotten him no never she was foolish to have thought so for a single moment she had always loved him always adored him the fire had been smothered and had smouldered for a time but she saw all plainly now it had but made headway and now it had burst forth afresh and had inflamed her whole being this note book was like a spark which had fallen from that other soul into hers she felt the conflagration starting up once more she imbued herself thoroughly with every word of the manuscript oh yes said she how perfectly i recognize all that that is what i had already read in his eyes as she was finishing it for the third time lieutenant théodule passed the gate once more and rattled his spurs upon the pavement cosette was forced to raise her eyes she thought him insipid silly stupid useless foppish displeasing impertinent and extremely ugly the officer thought it his duty to smile at her she turned away as in shame and indignation she would gladly have thrown something at his head she fled re entered the house and shut herself up in her chamber to peruse the manuscript once more to learn it by heart and to dream when she had thoroughly mastered it she kissed it and put it in her bosom all was over cosette had fallen back into deep seraphic love the abyss of eden had yawned once more all day long cosette remained in a sort of bewilderment she scarcely thought her ideas were in the state of a tangled skein in her brain she could not manage to conjecture anything she hoped through a tremor what vague things she dared make herself no promises and she did not wish to refuse herself anything flashes of pallor passed over her countenance and shivers ran through her frame it seemed to her at intervals that she was entering the land of chimæras she said to herself is this reality then she felt of the dear paper within her bosom under her gown she pressed it to her heart she felt its angles against her flesh and if jean valjean had seen her at the moment he would have shuddered in the presence of that luminous and unknown joy which overflowed from beneath her eyelids oh yes she thought it is certainly he this comes from him and is for me and she told herself that an intervention of the angels a celestial chance had given him back to her oh transfiguration of love oh dreams that celestial chance that intervention of the angels was a pellet of bread tossed by one thief to another thief from the charlemagne courtyard to the lion s ditch over the roofs of la force chapter vi old people are made to go out opportunely when evening came jean valjean went out cosette dressed herself she arranged her hair in the most becoming manner and she put on a dress whose bodice had received one snip of the scissors too much and which through this slope permitted a view of the beginning of her throat and was as young girls say a trifle indecent it was not in the least indecent but it was prettier than usual she made her toilet thus without knowing why she did so did she mean to go out no was she expecting a visitor no at dusk she went down to the garden toussaint was busy in her kitchen which opened on the back yard she began to stroll about under the trees thrusting aside the branches from time to time with her hand because there were some which hung very low in this manner she reached the bench the stone was still there she sat down and gently laid her white hand on this stone as though she wished to caress and thank it all at once she experienced that indefinable impression which one undergoes when there is some one standing behind one even when she does not see the person she turned her head and rose to her feet it was he his head was bare he appeared to have grown thin and pale his black clothes were hardly discernible the twilight threw a wan light on his fine brow and covered his eyes in shadows beneath a veil of incomparable sweetness he had something about him that suggested death and night his face was illuminated by the light of the dying day and by the thought of a soul that is taking flight he seemed to be not yet a ghost and he was no longer a man he had flung away his hat in the thicket a few paces distant cosette though ready to swoon uttered no cry she retreated slowly for she felt herself attracted he did not stir by virtue of something ineffable and melancholy which enveloped him she felt the look in his eyes which she could not see cosette in her retreat encountered a tree and leaned against it had it not been for this tree she would have fallen then she heard his voice that voice which she had really never heard barely rising above the rustle of the leaves and murmuring pardon me here i am my heart is full i could not live on as i was living and i have come have you read what i placed there on the bench do you recognize me at all have no fear of me it is a long time you remember the day since you looked at me at the luxembourg near the gladiator and the day when you passed before me it was on the 16th of june and the 2d of july it is nearly a year ago i have not seen you for a long time i inquired of the woman who let the chairs and she told me that she no longer saw you you lived in the rue de l ouest on the third floor in the front apartments of a new house you see that i know i followed you what else was there for me to do and then you disappeared i thought i saw you pass once while i was reading the newspapers under the arcade of the odéon i ran after you but no it was a person who had a bonnet like yours at night i came hither do not be afraid no one sees me i come to gaze upon your windows near at hand i walk very softly so that you may not hear for you might be alarmed the other evening i was behind you you turned round i fled once i heard you singing i was happy did it affect you because i heard you singing through the shutters that could not hurt you no it is not so you see you are my angel let me come sometimes i think that i am going to die if you only knew i adore you forgive me i speak to you but i do not know what i am saying i may have displeased you have i displeased you oh my mother said she and she sank down as though on the point of death he grasped her she fell he took her in his arms he pressed her close without knowing what he was doing he supported her though he was tottering himself it was as though his brain were full of smoke lightnings darted between his lips his ideas vanished it seemed to him that he was accomplishing some religious act and that he was committing a profanation moreover he had not the least passion for this lovely woman whose force he felt against his breast he was beside himself with love she took his hand and laid it on her heart he felt the paper there he stammered you love me then she replied in a voice so low that it was no longer anything more than a barely audible breath hush thou knowest it and she hid her blushing face on the breast of the superb and intoxicated young man he fell upon the bench and she beside him they had no words more the stars were beginning to gleam how did it come to pass that their lips met how comes it to pass that the birds sing that snow melts that the rose unfolds that may expands that the dawn grows white behind the black trees on the shivering crest of the hills a kiss and that was all both started and gazed into the darkness with sparkling eyes they felt neither the cool night nor the cold stone nor the damp earth nor the wet grass they looked at each other and their hearts were full of thoughts they had clasped hands unconsciously she did not ask him she did not even wonder how he had entered there and how he had made his way into the garden it seemed so simple to her that he should be there from time to time marius knee touched cosette s knee and both shivered at intervals cosette stammered a word her soul fluttered on her lips like a drop of dew on a flower little by little they began to talk to each other effusion followed silence which is fulness the night was serene and splendid overhead these two beings pure as spirits told each other everything their dreams their intoxications their ecstasies their chimæras their weaknesses how they had adored each other from afar how they had longed for each other their despair when they had ceased to see each other they confided to each other in an ideal intimacy which nothing could augment their most secret and most mysterious thoughts they related to each other with candid faith in their illusions all that love youth and the remains of childhood which still lingered about them suggested to their minds their two hearts poured themselves out into each other in such wise that at the expiration of a quarter of an hour it was the young man who had the young girl s soul and the young girl who had the young man s soul each became permeated with the other they were enchanted with each other they dazzled each other when they had finished when they had told each other everything she laid her head on his shoulder and asked him what is your name my name is marius said he and yours my name is cosette book sixth little gavroche chapter i the malicious playfulness of the wind since 1823 when the tavern of montfermeil was on the way to shipwreck and was being gradually engulfed not in the abyss of a bankruptcy but in the cesspool of petty debts the thénardier pair had had two other children both males that made five two girls and three boys madame thénardier had got rid of the last two while they were still young and very small with remarkable luck got rid of is the word there was but a mere fragment of nature in that woman a phenomenon by the way of which there is more than one example extant like the maréchale de la mothe houdancourt the thénardier was a mother to her daughters only there her maternity ended her hatred of the human race began with her own sons in the direction of her sons her evil disposition was uncompromising and her heart had a lugubrious wall in that quarter as the reader has seen she detested the eldest she cursed the other two why because the most terrible of motives the most unanswerable of retorts because i have no need of a litter of squalling brats said this mother let us explain how the thénardiers had succeeded in getting rid of their last two children and even in drawing profit from the operation the woman magnon who was mentioned a few pages further back was the same one who had succeeded in making old gillenormand support the two children which she had had she lived on the quai des célestins at the corner of this ancient street of the petit musc which afforded her the opportunity of changing her evil repute into good odor the reader will remember the great epidemic of croup which ravaged the river districts of the seine in paris thirty five years ago and of which science took advantage to make experiments on a grand scale as to the efficacy of inhalations of alum so beneficially replaced at the present day by the external tincture of iodine during this epidemic the magnon lost both her boys who were still very young one in the morning the other in the evening of the same day this was a blow these children were precious to their mother they represented eighty francs a month these eighty francs were punctually paid in the name of m gillenormand by collector of his rents m barge a retired tip staff in the rue du roi de sicile the children dead the income was at an end the magnon sought an expedient in that dark free masonry of evil of which she formed a part everything is known all secrets are kept and all lend mutual aid magnon needed two children the thénardiers had two the same sex the same age a good arrangement for the one a good investment for the other the little thénardiers became little magnons magnon quitted the quai des célestins and went to live in the rue clocheperce in paris the identity which binds an individual to himself is broken between one street and another the registry office being in no way warned raised no objections and the substitution was effected in the most simple manner in the world only the thénardier exacted for this loan of her children ten francs a month which magnon promised to pay and which she actually did pay it is unnecessary to add that m gillenormand continued to perform his compact he came to see the children every six months he did not perceive the change monsieur magnon said to him how much they resemble you thénardier to whom avatars were easy seized this occasion to become jondrette his two daughters and gavroche had hardly had time to discover that they had two little brothers when a certain degree of misery is reached one is overpowered with a sort of spectral indifference and one regards human beings as though they were spectres your nearest relations are often no more for you than vague shadowy forms barely outlined against a nebulous background of life and easily confounded again with the invisible on the evening of the day when she had handed over her two little ones to magnon with express intention of renouncing them forever the thénardier had felt or had appeared to feel a scruple she said to her husband but this is abandoning our children thénardier masterful and phlegmatic cauterized the scruple with this saying jean jacques rousseau did even better from scruples the mother proceeded to uneasiness but what if the police were to annoy us tell me monsieur thénardier is what we have done permissible thénardier replied everything is permissible no one will see anything but true blue in it besides no one has any interest in looking closely after children who have not a sou magnon was a sort of fashionable woman in the sphere of crime she was careful about her toilet she shared her lodgings which were furnished in an affected and wretched style with a clever gallicized english thief this english woman who had become a naturalized parisienne recommended by very wealthy relations intimately connected with the medals in the library and mademoiselle mar s diamonds became celebrated later on in judicial accounts she was called mamselle miss the two little creatures who had fallen to magnon had no reason to complain of their lot recommended by the eighty francs they were well cared for as is everything from which profit is derived they were neither badly clothed nor badly fed they were treated almost like little gentlemen better by their false mother than by their real one magnon played the lady and talked no thieves slang in their presence thus passed several years thénardier augured well from the fact one day he chanced to say to magnon as she handed him his monthly stipend of ten francs the father must give them some education all at once these two poor children who had up to that time been protected tolerably well even by their evil fate were abruptly hurled into life and forced to begin it for themselves a wholesale arrest of malefactors like that in the jondrette garret necessarily complicated by investigations and subsequent incarcerations is a veritable disaster for that hideous and occult counter society which pursues its existence beneath public society an adventure of this description entails all sorts of catastrophes in that sombre world the thénardier catastrophe involved the catastrophe of magnon one day a short time after magnon had handed to éponine the note relating to the rue plumet a sudden raid was made by the police in the rue clocheperce magnon was seized as was also mamselle miss and all the inhabitants of the house which was of a suspicious character were gathered into the net while this was going on the two little boys were playing in the back yard and saw nothing of the raid when they tried to enter the house again they found the door fastened and the house empty a cobbler opposite called them to him and delivered to them a paper which their mother had left for them on this paper there was an address m barge collector of rents rue du roi de sicile no 8 the proprietor of the stall said to them you cannot live here any longer go there it is near by the first street on the left ask your way from this paper the children set out the elder leading the younger and holding in his hand the paper which was to guide them it was cold and his benumbed little fingers could not close very firmly and they did not keep a very good hold on the paper at the corner of the rue clocheperce a gust of wind tore it from him and as night was falling the child was not able to find it again they began to wander aimlessly through the streets chapter ii in which little gavroche extracts profit from napoleon the great spring in paris is often traversed by harsh and piercing breezes which do not precisely chill but freeze one these north winds which sadden the most beautiful days produce exactly the effect of those puffs of cold air which enter a warm room through the cracks of a badly fitting door or window it seems as though the gloomy door of winter had remained ajar and as though the wind were pouring through it in the spring of 1832 the epoch when the first great epidemic of this century broke out in europe these north gales were more harsh and piercing than ever it was a door even more glacial than that of winter which was ajar it was the door of the sepulchre in these winds one felt the breath of the cholera from a meteorological point of view these cold winds possessed this peculiarity that they did not preclude a strong electric tension frequent storms accompanied by thunder and lightning burst forth at this epoch one evening when these gales were blowing rudely to such a degree that january seemed to have returned and that the bourgeois had resumed their cloaks little gavroche who was always shivering gayly under his rags was standing as though in ecstasy before a wig maker s shop in the vicinity of the orme saint gervais he was adorned with a woman s woollen shawl picked up no one knows where and which he had converted into a neck comforter little gavroche appeared to be engaged in intent admiration of a wax bride in a low necked dress and crowned with orange flowers who was revolving in the window and displaying her smile to passers by between two argand lamps but in reality he was taking an observation of the shop in order to discover whether he could not prig from the shop front a cake of soap which he would then proceed to sell for a sou to a hair dresser in the suburbs he had often managed to breakfast off of such a roll he called his species of work for which he possessed special aptitude shaving barbers while contemplating the bride and eyeing the cake of soap he muttered between his teeth tuesday it was not tuesday was it tuesday perhaps it was tuesday yes it was tuesday no one has ever discovered to what this monologue referred yes perchance this monologue had some connection with the last occasion on which he had dined three days before for it was now friday the barber in his shop which was warmed by a good stove was shaving a customer and casting a glance from time to time at the enemy that freezing and impudent street urchin both of whose hands were in his pockets but whose mind was evidently unsheathed while gavroche was scrutinizing the shop window and the cakes of windsor soap two children of unequal stature very neatly dressed and still smaller than himself one apparently about seven years of age the other five timidly turned the handle and entered the shop with a request for something or other alms possibly in a plaintive murmur which resembled a groan rather than a prayer they both spoke at once and their words were unintelligible because sobs broke the voice of the younger and the teeth of the elder were chattering with cold the barber wheeled round with a furious look and without abandoning his razor thrust back the elder with his left hand and the younger with his knee and slammed his door saying the idea of coming in and freezing everybody for nothing the two children resumed their march in tears in the meantime a cloud had risen it had begun to rain little gavroche ran after them and accosted them what s the matter with you brats we don t know where we are to sleep replied the elder is that all said gavroche a great matter truly the idea of bawling about that they must be greenies and adopting in addition to his superiority which was rather bantering an accent of tender authority and gentle patronage come along with me young uns yes sir said the elder and the two children followed him as they would have followed an archbishop they had stopped crying gavroche led them up the rue saint antoine in the direction of the bastille as gavroche walked along he cast an indignant backward glance at the barber s shop that fellow has no heart the whiting 35 he muttered he s an englishman a woman who caught sight of these three marching in a file with gavroche at their head burst into noisy laughter this laugh was wanting in respect towards the group good day mamselle omnibus said gavroche to her an instant later the wig maker occurred to his mind once more and he added i am making a mistake in the beast he s not a whiting he s a serpent barber i ll go and fetch a locksmith and i ll have a bell hung to your tail this wig maker had rendered him aggressive as he strode over a gutter he apostrophized a bearded portress who was worthy to meet faust on the brocken and who had a broom in her hand madam said he so you are going out with your horse and thereupon he spattered the polished boots of a pedestrian you scamp shouted the furious pedestrian gavroche elevated his nose above his shawl is monsieur complaining of you ejaculated the man the office is closed said gavroche i do not receive any more complaints in the meanwhile as he went on up the street he perceived a beggar girl thirteen or fourteen years old and clad in so short a gown that her knees were visible lying thoroughly chilled under a porte cochère the little girl was getting to be too old for such a thing growth does play these tricks the petticoat becomes short at the moment when nudity becomes indecent poor girl said gavroche she hasn t even trousers hold on take this and unwinding all the comfortable woollen which he had around his neck he flung it on the thin and purple shoulders of the beggar girl where the scarf became a shawl once more the child stared at him in astonishment and received the shawl in silence when a certain stage of distress has been reached in his misery the poor man no longer groans over evil no longer returns thanks for good that done brrr said gavroche who was shivering more than saint martin for the latter retained one half of his cloak at this brrr the downpour of rain redoubled in its spite became furious the wicked skies punish good deeds ah come now exclaimed gavroche what s the meaning of this it s re raining good heavens if it goes on like this i shall stop my subscription and he set out on the march once more it s all right he resumed casting a glance at the beggar girl as she coiled up under the shawl she s got a famous peel and looking up at the clouds he exclaimed caught the two children followed close on his heels as they were passing one of these heavy grated lattices which indicate a baker s shop for bread is put behind bars like gold gavroche turned round ah by the way brats have we dined monsieur replied the elder we have had nothing to eat since this morning so you have neither father nor mother resumed gavroche majestically excuse us sir we have a papa and a mamma but we don t know where they are sometimes that s better than knowing where they are said gavroche who was a thinker we have been wandering about these two hours continued the elder we have hunted for things at the corners of the streets but we have found nothing i know ejaculated gavroche it s the dogs who eat everything he went on after a pause ah we have lost our authors we don t know what we have done with them this should not be gamins it s stupid to let old people stray off like that come now we must have a snooze all the same however he asked them no questions what was more simple than that they should have no dwelling place the elder of the two children who had almost entirely recovered the prompt heedlessness of childhood uttered this exclamation it s queer all the same mamma told us that she would take us to get a blessed spray on palm sunday bosh said gavroche mamma resumed the elder is a lady who lives with mamselle miss tanflûte retorted gavroche meanwhile he had halted and for the last two minutes he had been feeling and fumbling in all sorts of nooks which his rags contained at last he tossed his head with an air intended to be merely satisfied but which was triumphant in reality let us be calm young uns here s supper for three and from one of his pockets he drew forth a sou without allowing the two urchins time for amazement he pushed both of them before him into the baker s shop and flung his sou on the counter crying boy five centimes worth of bread the baker who was the proprietor in person took up a loaf and a knife in three pieces my boy went on gavroche and he added with dignity there are three of us and seeing that the baker after scrutinizing the three customers had taken down a black loaf he thrust his finger far up his nose with an inhalation as imperious as though he had had a pinch of the great frederick s snuff on the tip of his thumb and hurled this indignant apostrophe full in the baker s face keksekça those of our readers who might be tempted to espy in this interpellation of gavroche s to the baker a russian or a polish word or one of those savage cries which the yoways and the botocudos hurl at each other from bank to bank of a river athwart the solitudes are warned that it is a word which they our readers utter every day and which takes the place of the phrase qu est ce que c est que cela the baker understood perfectly and replied well it s bread and very good bread of the second quality you mean larton brutal black bread retorted gavroche calmly and coldly disdainful white bread boy white bread larton savonné i m standing treat the baker could not repress a smile and as he cut the white bread he surveyed them in a compassionate way which shocked gavroche come now baker s boy said he what are you taking our measure like that for all three of them placed end to end would have hardly made a measure when the bread was cut the baker threw the sou into his drawer and gavroche said to the two children grub away the little boys stared at him in surprise gavroche began to laugh ah hullo that s so they don t understand yet they re too small and he repeated eat away at the same time he held out a piece of bread to each of them and thinking that the elder who seemed to him the more worthy of his conversation deserved some special encouragement and ought to be relieved from all hesitation to satisfy his appetite he added as he handed him the largest share ram that into your muzzle one piece was smaller than the others he kept this for himself the poor children including gavroche were famished as they tore their bread apart in big mouthfuls they blocked up the shop of the baker who now that they had paid their money looked angrily at them let s go into the street again said gavroche they set off once more in the direction of the bastille from time to time as they passed the lighted shop windows the smallest halted to look at the time on a leaden watch which was suspended from his neck by a cord well he is a very green un said gavroche then becoming thoughtful he muttered between his teeth all the same if i had charge of the babes i d lock em up better than that just as they were finishing their morsel of bread and had reached the angle of that gloomy rue des ballets at the other end of which the low and threatening wicket of la force was visible hullo is that you gavroche said some one hullo is that you montparnasse said gavroche a man had just accosted the street urchin and the man was no other than montparnasse in disguise with blue spectacles but recognizable to gavroche the bow wows went on gavroche you ve got a hide the color of a linseed plaster and blue specs like a doctor you re putting on style pon my word hush ejaculated montparnasse not so loud and he drew gavroche hastily out of range of the lighted shops the two little ones followed mechanically holding each other by the hand when they were ensconced under the arch of a porte cochère sheltered from the rain and from all eyes do you know where i m going demanded montparnasse to the abbey of ascend with regret 36 replied gavroche joker and montparnasse went on i m going to find babet ah exclaimed gavroche so her name is babet montparnasse lowered his voice not she he ah babet yes babet i thought he was buckled he has undone the buckle replied montparnasse and he rapidly related to the gamin how on the morning of that very day babet having been transferred to la conciergerie had made his escape by turning to the left instead of to the right in the police office gavroche expressed his admiration for this skill what a dentist he cried montparnasse added a few details as to babet s flight and ended with oh that s not all gavroche as he listened had seized a cane that montparnasse held in his hand and mechanically pulled at the upper part and the blade of a dagger made its appearance ah he exclaimed pushing the dagger back in haste you have brought along your gendarme disguised as a bourgeois montparnasse winked the deuce resumed gavroche so you re going to have a bout with the bobbies you can t tell replied montparnasse with an indifferent air it s always a good thing to have a pin about one gavroche persisted what are you up to to night again montparnasse took a grave tone and said mouthing every syllable things and abruptly changing the conversation by the way what something happened t other day fancy i meet a bourgeois he makes me a present of a sermon and his purse i put it in my pocket a minute later i feel in my pocket there s nothing there except the sermon said gavroche but you went on montparnasse where are you bound for now gavroche pointed to his two protégés and said i m going to put these infants to bed whereabouts is the bed at my house where s your house at my house so you have a lodging yes i have and where is your lodging in the elephant said gavroche montparnasse though not naturally inclined to astonishment could not restrain an exclamation in the elephant well yes in the elephant retorted gavroche kekçaa this is another word of the language which no one writes and which every one speaks kekçaa signifies qu est que c est que cela a what s the matter with that the urchin s profound remark recalled montparnasse to calmness and good sense he appeared to return to better sentiments with regard to gavroche s lodging of course said he yes the elephant is it comfortable there very said gavroche it s really bully there there ain t any draughts as there are under the bridges how do you get in oh i get in so there is a hole demanded montparnasse parbleu i should say so but you mustn t tell it s between the fore legs the bobbies haven t seen it and you climb up yes i understand a turn of the hand cric crac and it s all over no one there after a pause gavroche added i shall have a ladder for these children montparnasse burst out laughing where the devil did you pick up those young uns gavroche replied with great simplicity they are some brats that a wig maker made me a present of meanwhile montparnasse had fallen to thinking you recognized me very readily he muttered he took from his pocket two small objects which were nothing more than two quills wrapped in cotton and thrust one up each of his nostrils this gave him a different nose that changes you remarked gavroche you are less homely so you ought to keep them on all the time montparnasse was a handsome fellow but gavroche was a tease seriously demanded montparnasse how do you like me so the sound of his voice was different also in a twinkling montparnasse had become unrecognizable oh do play porrichinelle for us exclaimed gavroche the two children who had not been listening up to this point being occupied themselves in thrusting their fingers up their noses drew near at this name and stared at montparnasse with dawning joy and admiration unfortunately montparnasse was troubled he laid his hand on gavroche s shoulder and said to him emphasizing his words listen to what i tell you boy if i were on the square with my dog my knife and my wife and if you were to squander ten sous on me i wouldn t refuse to work but this isn t shrove tuesday this odd phrase produced a singular effect on the gamin he wheeled round hastily darted his little sparkling eyes about him with profound attention and perceived a police sergeant standing with his back to them a few paces off gavroche allowed an ah good to escape him but immediately suppressed it and shaking montparnasse s hand well good evening said he i m going off to my elephant with my brats supposing that you should need me some night you can come and hunt me up there i lodge on the entresol there is no porter you will inquire for monsieur gavroche very good said montparnasse and they parted montparnasse betaking himself in the direction of the grève and gavroche towards the bastille the little one of five dragged along by his brother who was dragged by gavroche turned his head back several times to watch porrichinelle as he went the ambiguous phrase by means of which montparnasse had warned gavroche of the presence of the policeman contained no other talisman than the assonance dig repeated five or six times in different forms this syllable dig uttered alone or artistically mingled with the words of a phrase means take care we can no longer talk freely there was besides in montparnasse s sentence a literary beauty which was lost upon gavroche that is mon dogue ma dague et ma digue a slang expression of the temple which signifies my dog my knife and my wife greatly in vogue among clowns and the red tails in the great century when molière wrote and callot drew twenty years ago there was still to be seen in the southwest corner of the place de la bastille near the basin of the canal excavated in the ancient ditch of the fortress prison a singular monument which has already been effaced from the memories of parisians and which deserved to leave some trace for it was the idea of a member of the institute the general in chief of the army of egypt we say monument although it was only a rough model but this model itself a marvellous sketch the grandiose skeleton of an idea of napoleon s which successive gusts of wind have carried away and thrown on each occasion still further from us had become historical and had acquired a certain definiteness which contrasted with its provisional aspect it was an elephant forty feet high constructed of timber and masonry bearing on its back a tower which resembled a house formerly painted green by some dauber and now painted black by heaven the wind and time in this deserted and unprotected corner of the place the broad brow of the colossus his trunk his tusks his tower his enormous crupper his four feet like columns produced at night under the starry heavens a surprising and terrible form it was a sort of symbol of popular force it was sombre mysterious and immense it was some mighty visible phantom one knew not what standing erect beside the invisible spectre of the bastille few strangers visited this edifice no passer by looked at it it was falling into ruins every season the plaster which detached itself from its sides formed hideous wounds upon it the ædiles as the expression ran in elegant dialect had forgotten it ever since 1814 there it stood in its corner melancholy sick crumbling surrounded by a rotten palisade soiled continually by drunken coachmen cracks meandered athwart its belly a lath projected from its tail tall grass flourished between its legs and as the level of the place had been rising all around it for a space of thirty years by that slow and continuous movement which insensibly elevates the soil of large towns it stood in a hollow and it looked as though the ground were giving way beneath it it was unclean despised repulsive and superb ugly in the eyes of the bourgeois melancholy in the eyes of the thinker there was something about it of the dirt which is on the point of being swept out and something of the majesty which is on the point of being decapitated as we have said at night its aspect changed night is the real element of everything that is dark as soon as twilight descended the old elephant became transfigured he assumed a tranquil and redoubtable appearance in the formidable serenity of the shadows being of the past he belonged to night and obscurity was in keeping with his grandeur this rough squat heavy hard austere almost misshapen but assuredly majestic monument stamped with a sort of magnificent and savage gravity has disappeared and left to reign in peace a sort of gigantic stove ornamented with its pipe which has replaced the sombre fortress with its nine towers very much as the bourgeoisie replaces the feudal classes it is quite natural that a stove should be the symbol of an epoch in which a pot contains power this epoch will pass away people have already begun to understand that if there can be force in a boiler there can be no force except in the brain in other words that which leads and drags on the world is not locomotives but ideas harness locomotives to ideas that is well done but do not mistake the horse for the rider at all events to return to the place de la bastille the architect of this elephant succeeded in making a grand thing out of plaster the architect of the stove has succeeded in making a pretty thing out of bronze this stove pipe which has been baptized by a sonorous name and called the column of july this monument of a revolution that miscarried was still enveloped in 1832 in an immense shirt of woodwork which we regret for our part and by a vast plank enclosure which completed the task of isolating the elephant it was towards this corner of the place dimly lighted by the reflection of a distant street lamp that the gamin guided his two brats the reader must permit us to interrupt ourselves here and to remind him that we are dealing with simple reality and that twenty years ago the tribunals were called upon to judge under the charge of vagabondage and mutilation of a public monument a child who had been caught asleep in this very elephant of the bastille this fact noted we proceed on arriving in the vicinity of the colossus gavroche comprehended the effect which the infinitely great might produce on the infinitely small and said don t be scared infants then he entered through a gap in the fence into the elephant s enclosure and helped the young ones to clamber through the breach the two children somewhat frightened followed gavroche without uttering a word and confided themselves to this little providence in rags which had given them bread and had promised them a shelter there extended along the fence lay a ladder which by day served the laborers in the neighboring timber yard gavroche raised it with remarkable vigor and placed it against one of the elephant s forelegs near the point where the ladder ended a sort of black hole in the belly of the colossus could be distinguished gavroche pointed out the ladder and the hole to his guests and said to them climb up and go in the two little boys exchanged terrified glances you re afraid brats exclaimed gavroche and he added you shall see he clasped the rough leg of the elephant and in a twinkling without deigning to make use of the ladder he had reached the aperture he entered it as an adder slips through a crevice and disappeared within and an instant later the two children saw his head which looked pale appear vaguely on the edge of the shadowy hole like a wan and whitish spectre well he exclaimed climb up young uns you ll see how snug it is here come up you he said to the elder i ll lend you a hand the little fellows nudged each other the gamin frightened and inspired them with confidence at one and the same time and then it was raining very hard the elder one undertook the risk the younger on seeing his brother climbing up and himself left alone between the paws of this huge beast felt greatly inclined to cry but he did not dare the elder lad climbed with uncertain steps up the rungs of the ladder gavroche in the meanwhile encouraging him with exclamations like a fencing master to his pupils or a muleteer to his mules don t be afraid that s it come on put your feet there give us your hand here boldly and when the child was within reach he seized him suddenly and vigorously by the arm and pulled him towards him nabbed said he the brat had passed through the crack now said gavroche wait for me be so good as to take a seat monsieur and making his way out of the hole as he had entered it he slipped down the elephant s leg with the agility of a monkey landed on his feet in the grass grasped the child of five round the body and planted him fairly in the middle of the ladder then he began to climb up behind him shouting to the elder i m going to boost him do you tug and in another instant the small lad was pushed dragged pulled thrust stuffed into the hole before he had time to recover himself and gavroche entering behind him and repulsing the ladder with a kick which sent it flat on the grass began to clap his hands and to cry here we are long live general lafayette this explosion over he added now young uns you are in my house gavroche was at home in fact oh unforeseen utility of the useless charity of great things goodness of giants this huge monument which had embodied an idea of the emperor s had become the box of a street urchin the brat had been accepted and sheltered by the colossus the bourgeois decked out in their sunday finery who passed the elephant of the bastille were fond of saying as they scanned it disdainfully with their prominent eyes what s the good of that it served to save from the cold the frost the hail and rain to shelter from the winds of winter to preserve from slumber in the mud which produces fever and from slumber in the snow which produces death a little being who had no father no mother no bread no clothes no refuge it served to receive the innocent whom society repulsed it served to diminish public crime it was a lair open to one against whom all doors were shut it seemed as though the miserable old mastodon invaded by vermin and oblivion covered with warts with mould and ulcers tottering worm eaten abandoned condemned a sort of mendicant colossus asking alms in vain with a benevolent look in the midst of the cross roads had taken pity on that other mendicant the poor pygmy who roamed without shoes to his feet without a roof over his head blowing on his fingers clad in rags fed on rejected scraps that was what the elephant of the bastille was good for this idea of napoleon disdained by men had been taken back by god that which had been merely illustrious had become august in order to realize his thought the emperor should have had porphyry brass iron gold marble the old collection of planks beams and plaster sufficed for god the emperor had had the dream of a genius in that titanic elephant armed prodigious with trunk uplifted bearing its tower and scattering on all sides its merry and vivifying waters he wished to incarnate the people god had done a grander thing with it he had lodged a child there the hole through which gavroche had entered was a breach which was hardly visible from the outside being concealed as we have stated beneath the elephant s belly and so narrow that it was only cats and homeless children who could pass through it let s begin said gavroche by telling the porter that we are not at home and plunging into the darkness with the assurance of a person who is well acquainted with his apartments he took a plank and stopped up the aperture again gavroche plunged into the obscurity the children heard the crackling of the match thrust into the phosphoric bottle the chemical match was not yet in existence at that epoch the fumade steel represented progress a sudden light made them blink gavroche had just managed to ignite one of those bits of cord dipped in resin which are called cellar rats the cellar rat which emitted more smoke than light rendered the interior of the elephant confusedly visible gavroche s two guests glanced about them and the sensation which they experienced was something like that which one would feel if shut up in the great tun of heidelberg or better still like what jonah must have felt in the biblical belly of the whale an entire and gigantic skeleton appeared enveloping them above a long brown beam whence started at regular distances massive arching ribs represented the vertebral column with its sides stalactites of plaster depended from them like entrails and vast spiders webs stretching from side to side formed dirty diaphragms here and there in the corners were visible large blackish spots which had the appearance of being alive and which changed places rapidly with an abrupt and frightened movement fragments which had fallen from the elephant s back into his belly had filled up the cavity so that it was possible to walk upon it as on a floor the smaller child nestled up against his brother and whispered to him it s black this remark drew an exclamation from gavroche the petrified air of the two brats rendered some shock necessary what s that you are gabbling about there he exclaimed are you scoffing at me are you turning up your noses do you want the tuileries are you brutes come say i warn you that i don t belong to the regiment of simpletons ah come now are you brats from the pope s establishment a little roughness is good in cases of fear it is reassuring the two children drew close to gavroche gavroche paternally touched by this confidence passed from grave to gentle and addressing the smaller stupid said he accenting the insulting word with a caressing intonation it s outside that it is black outside it s raining here it does not rain outside it s cold here there s not an atom of wind outside there are heaps of people here there s no one outside there ain t even the moon here there s my candle confound it the two children began to look upon the apartment with less terror but gavroche allowed them no more time for contemplation quick said he and he pushed them towards what we are very glad to be able to call the end of the room there stood his bed gavroche s bed was complete that is to say it had a mattress a blanket and an alcove with curtains the mattress was a straw mat the blanket a rather large strip of gray woollen stuff very warm and almost new this is what the alcove consisted of three rather long poles thrust into and consolidated with the rubbish which formed the floor that is to say the belly of the elephant two in front and one behind and united by a rope at their summits so as to form a pyramidal bundle this cluster supported a trellis work of brass wire which was simply placed upon it but artistically applied and held by fastenings of iron wire so that it enveloped all three holes a row of very heavy stones kept this network down to the floor so that nothing could pass under it this grating was nothing else than a piece of the brass screens with which aviaries are covered in menageries gavroche s bed stood as in a cage behind this net the whole resembled an esquimaux tent this trellis work took the place of curtains gavroche moved aside the stones which fastened the net down in front and the two folds of the net which lapped over each other fell apart down on all fours brats said gavroche he made his guests enter the cage with great precaution then he crawled in after them pulled the stones together and closed the opening hermetically again all three had stretched out on the mat gavroche still had the cellar rat in his hand now said he go to sleep i m going to suppress the candelabra monsieur the elder of the brothers asked gavroche pointing to the netting what s that for that answered gavroche gravely is for the rats go to sleep nevertheless he felt obliged to add a few words of instruction for the benefit of these young creatures and he continued it s a thing from the jardin des plantes it s used for fierce animals there s a whole shopful of them there all you ve got to do is to climb over a wall crawl through a window and pass through a door you can get as much as you want as he spoke he wrapped the younger one up bodily in a fold of the blanket and the little one murmured oh how good that is it s warm gavroche cast a pleased eye on the blanket that s from the jardin des plantes too said he i took that from the monkeys and pointing out to the eldest the mat on which he was lying a very thick and admirably made mat he added that belonged to the giraffe after a pause he went on the beasts had all these things i took them away from them it didn t trouble them i told them it s for the elephant he paused and then resumed you crawl over the walls and you don t care a straw for the government so there now the two children gazed with timid and stupefied respect on this intrepid and ingenious being a vagabond like themselves isolated like themselves frail like themselves who had something admirable and all powerful about him who seemed supernatural to them and whose physiognomy was composed of all the grimaces of an old mountebank mingled with the most ingenuous and charming smiles monsieur ventured the elder timidly you are not afraid of the police then gavroche contented himself with replying brat nobody says police they say bobbies the smaller had his eyes wide open but he said nothing as he was on the edge of the mat the elder being in the middle gavroche tucked the blanket round him as a mother might have done and heightened the mat under his head with old rags in such a way as to form a pillow for the child then he turned to the elder hey we re jolly comfortable here ain t we ah yes replied the elder gazing at gavroche with the expression of a saved angel the two poor little children who had been soaked through began to grow warm once more ah by the way continued gavroche what were you bawling about and pointing out the little one to his brother a mite like that i ve nothing to say about but the idea of a big fellow like you crying it s idiotic you looked like a calf gracious replied the child we have no lodging bother retorted gavroche you don t say lodgings you say crib and then we were afraid of being alone like that at night you don t say night you say darkmans thank you sir said the child listen went on gavroche you must never bawl again over anything i ll take care of you you shall see what fun we ll have in summer we ll go to the glacière with navet one of my pals we ll bathe in the gare we ll run stark naked in front of the rafts on the bridge at austerlitz that makes the laundresses raging they scream they get mad and if you only knew how ridiculous they are we ll go and see the man skeleton and then i ll take you to the play i ll take you to see frédérick lemaître i have tickets i know some of the actors i even played in a piece once there were a lot of us fellers and we ran under a cloth and that made the sea i ll get you an engagement at my theatre we ll go to see the savages they ain t real those savages ain t they wear pink tights that go all in wrinkles and you can see where their elbows have been darned with white then we ll go to the opera we ll get in with the hired applauders the opera claque is well managed i wouldn t associate with the claque on the boulevard at the opera just fancy some of them pay twenty sous but they re ninnies they re called dishclouts and then we ll go to see the guillotine work i ll show you the executioner he lives in the rue des marais monsieur sanson he has a letter box at his door ah we ll have famous fun at that moment a drop of wax fell on gavroche s finger and recalled him to the realities of life the deuce said he there s the wick giving out attention i can t spend more than a sou a month on my lighting when a body goes to bed he must sleep we haven t the time to read m paul de kock s romances and besides the light might pass through the cracks of the porte cochère and all the bobbies need to do is to see it and then remarked the elder timidly he alone dared talk to gavroche and reply to him a spark might fall in the straw and we must look out and not burn the house down people don t say burn the house down remarked gavroche they say blaze the crib the storm increased in violence and the heavy downpour beat upon the back of the colossus amid claps of thunder you re taken in rain said gavroche it amuses me to hear the decanter run down the legs of the house winter is a stupid it wastes its merchandise it loses its labor it can t wet us and that makes it kick up a row old water carrier that it is this allusion to the thunder all the consequences of which gavroche in his character of a philosopher of the nineteenth century accepted was followed by a broad flash of lightning so dazzling that a hint of it entered the belly of the elephant through the crack almost at the same instant the thunder rumbled with great fury the two little creatures uttered a shriek and started up so eagerly that the network came near being displaced but gavroche turned his bold face to them and took advantage of the clap of thunder to burst into a laugh calm down children don t topple over the edifice that s fine first class thunder all right that s no slouch of a streak of lightning bravo for the good god deuce take it it s almost as good as it is at the ambigu that said he restored order in the netting pushed the two children gently down on the bed pressed their knees in order to stretch them out at full length and exclaimed since the good god is lighting his candle i can blow out mine now babes now my young humans you must shut your peepers it s very bad not to sleep it ll make you swallow the strainer or as they say in fashionable society stink in the gullet wrap yourself up well in the hide i m going to put out the light are you ready yes murmured the elder i m all right i seem to have feathers under my head people don t say head cried gavroche they say nut the two children nestled close to each other gavroche finished arranging them on the mat drew the blanket up to their very ears then repeated for the third time his injunction in the hieratical tongue shut your peepers and he snuffed out his tiny light hardly had the light been extinguished when a peculiar trembling began to affect the netting under which the three children lay it consisted of a multitude of dull scratches which produced a metallic sound as if claws and teeth were gnawing at the copper wire this was accompanied by all sorts of little piercing cries the little five year old boy on hearing this hubbub overhead and chilled with terror jogged his brother s elbow but the elder brother had already shut his peepers as gavroche had ordered then the little one who could no longer control his terror questioned gavroche but in a very low tone and with bated breath sir hey said gavroche who had just closed his eyes what is that it s the rats replied gavroche and he laid his head down on the mat again the rats in fact who swarmed by thousands in the carcass of the elephant and who were the living black spots which we have already mentioned had been held in awe by the flame of the candle so long as it had been lighted but as soon as the cavern which was the same as their city had returned to darkness scenting what the good story teller perrault calls fresh meat they had hurled themselves in throngs on gavroche s tent had climbed to the top of it and had begun to bite the meshes as though seeking to pierce this new fangled trap still the little one could not sleep sir he began again hey said gavroche what are rats they are mice this explanation reassured the child a little he had seen white mice in the course of his life and he was not afraid of them nevertheless he lifted up his voice once more sir hey said gavroche again why don t you have a cat i did have one replied gavroche i brought one here but they ate her this second explanation undid the work of the first and the little fellow began to tremble again the dialogue between him and gavroche began again for the fourth time monsieur hey who was it that was eaten the cat and who ate the cat the rats the mice yes the rats the child in consternation dismayed at the thought of mice which ate cats pursued sir would those mice eat us wouldn t they just ejaculated gavroche the child s terror had reached its climax but gavroche added don t be afraid they can t get in and besides i m here here catch hold of my hand hold your tongue and shut your peepers at the same time gavroche grasped the little fellow s hand across his brother the child pressed the hand close to him and felt reassured courage and strength have these mysterious ways of communicating themselves silence reigned round them once more the sound of their voices had frightened off the rats at the expiration of a few minutes they came raging back but in vain the three little fellows were fast asleep and heard nothing more the hours of the night fled away darkness covered the vast place de la bastille a wintry gale which mingled with the rain blew in gusts the patrol searched all the doorways alleys enclosures and obscure nooks and in their search for nocturnal vagabonds they passed in silence before the elephant the monster erect motionless staring open eyed into the shadows had the appearance of dreaming happily over his good deed and sheltered from heaven and from men the three poor sleeping children in order to understand what is about to follow the reader must remember that at that epoch the bastille guard house was situated at the other end of the square and that what took place in the vicinity of the elephant could neither be seen nor heard by the sentinel towards the end of that hour which immediately precedes the dawn a man turned from the rue saint antoine at a run made the circuit of the enclosure of the column of july and glided between the palings until he was underneath the belly of the elephant if any light had illuminated that man it might have been divined from the thorough manner in which he was soaked that he had passed the night in the rain arrived beneath the elephant he uttered a peculiar cry which did not belong to any human tongue and which a paroquet alone could have imitated twice he repeated this cry of whose orthography the following barely conveys an idea kirikikiou at the second cry a clear young merry voice responded from the belly of the elephant yes almost immediately the plank which closed the hole was drawn aside and gave passage to a child who descended the elephant s leg and fell briskly near the man it was gavroche the man was montparnasse as for his cry of kirikikiou that was doubtless what the child had meant when he said you will ask for monsieur gavroche on hearing it he had waked with a start had crawled out of his alcove pushing apart the netting a little and carefully drawing it together again then he had opened the trap and descended the man and the child recognized each other silently amid the gloom montparnasse confined himself to the remark we need you come lend us a hand the lad asked for no further enlightenment i m with you said he and both took their way towards the rue saint antoine whence montparnasse had emerged winding rapidly through the long file of market gardeners carts which descend towards the markets at that hour the market gardeners crouching half asleep in their wagons amid the salads and vegetables enveloped to their very eyes in their mufflers on account of the beating rain did not even glance at these strange pedestrians chapter iii the vicissitudes of flight this is what had taken place that same night at the la force an escape had been planned between babet brujon guelemer and thénardier although thénardier was in close confinement babet had arranged the matter for his own benefit on the same day as the reader has seen from montparnasse s account to gavroche montparnasse was to help them from outside brujon after having passed a month in the punishment cell had had time in the first place to weave a rope in the second to mature a plan in former times those severe places where the discipline of the prison delivers the convict into his own hands were composed of four stone walls a stone ceiling a flagged pavement a camp bed a grated window and a door lined with iron and were called dungeons but the dungeon was judged to be too terrible nowadays they are composed of an iron door a grated window a camp bed a flagged pavement four stone walls and a stone ceiling and are called chambers of punishment a little light penetrates towards mid day the inconvenient point about these chambers which as the reader sees are not dungeons is that they allow the persons who should be at work to think so brujon meditated and he emerged from the chamber of punishment with a rope as he had the name of being very dangerous in the charlemagne courtyard he was placed in the new building the first thing he found in the new building was guelemer the second was a nail guelemer that is to say crime a nail that is to say liberty brujon of whom it is high time that the reader should have a complete idea was with an appearance of delicate health and a profoundly premeditated languor a polished intelligent sprig and a thief who had a caressing glance and an atrocious smile his glance resulted from his will and his smile from his nature his first studies in his art had been directed to roofs he had made great progress in the industry of the men who tear off lead who plunder the roofs and despoil the gutters by the process called double pickings the circumstance which put the finishing touch on the moment peculiarly favorable for an attempt at escape was that the roofers were re laying and re jointing at that very moment a portion of the slates on the prison the saint bernard courtyard was no longer absolutely isolated from the charlemagne and the saint louis courts up above there were scaffoldings and ladders in other words bridges and stairs in the direction of liberty the new building which was the most cracked and decrepit thing to be seen anywhere in the world was the weak point in the prison the walls were eaten by saltpetre to such an extent that the authorities had been obliged to line the vaults of the dormitories with a sheathing of wood because stones were in the habit of becoming detached and falling on the prisoners in their beds in spite of this antiquity the authorities committed the error of confining in the new building the most troublesome prisoners of placing there the hard cases as they say in prison parlance the new building contained four dormitories one above the other and a top story which was called the bel air fine air a large chimney flue probably from some ancient kitchen of the dukes de la force started from the groundfloor traversed all four stories cut the dormitories where it figured as a flattened pillar into two portions and finally pierced the roof guelemer and brujon were in the same dormitory they had been placed by way of precaution on the lower story chance ordained that the heads of their beds should rest against the chimney thénardier was directly over their heads in the top story known as fine air the pedestrian who halts on the rue culture sainte catherine after passing the barracks of the firemen in front of the porte cochère of the bathing establishment beholds a yard full of flowers and shrubs in wooden boxes at the extremity of which spreads out a little white rotunda with two wings brightened up with green shutters the bucolic dream of jean jacques not more than ten years ago there rose above that rotunda an enormous black hideous bare wall by which it was backed up this was the outer wall of la force this wall beside that rotunda was milton viewed through berquin lofty as it was this wall was overtopped by a still blacker roof which could be seen beyond this was the roof of the new building there one could descry four dormer windows guarded with bars they were the windows of the fine air a chimney pierced the roof this was the chimney which traversed the dormitories the bel air that top story of the new building was a sort of large hall with a mansard roof guarded with triple gratings and double doors of sheet iron which were studded with enormous bolts when one entered from the north end one had on one s left the four dormer windows on one s right facing the windows at regular intervals four square tolerably vast cages separated by narrow passages built of masonry to about the height of the elbow and the rest up to the roof of iron bars thénardier had been in solitary confinement in one of these cages since the night of the 3d of february no one was ever able to discover how and by what connivance he succeeded in procuring and secreting a bottle of wine invented so it is said by desrues with which a narcotic is mixed and which the band of the endormeurs or sleep compellers rendered famous there are in many prisons treacherous employees half jailers half thieves who assist in escapes who sell to the police an unfaithful service and who turn a penny whenever they can on that same night then when little gavroche picked up the two lost children brujon and guelemer who knew that babet who had escaped that morning was waiting for them in the street as well as montparnasse rose softly and with the nail which brujon had found began to pierce the chimney against which their beds stood the rubbish fell on brujon s bed so that they were not heard showers mingled with thunder shook the doors on their hinges and created in the prison a terrible and opportune uproar those of the prisoners who woke pretended to fall asleep again and left guelemer and brujon to their own devices brujon was adroit guelemer was vigorous before any sound had reached the watcher who was sleeping in the grated cell which opened into the dormitory the wall had been pierced the chimney scaled the iron grating which barred the upper orifice of the flue forced and the two redoubtable ruffians were on the roof the wind and rain redoubled the roof was slippery what a good night to leg it said brujon an abyss six feet broad and eighty feet deep separated them from the surrounding wall at the bottom of this abyss they could see the musket of a sentinel gleaming through the gloom they fastened one end of the rope which brujon had spun in his dungeon to the stumps of the iron bars which they had just wrenched off flung the other over the outer wall crossed the abyss at one bound clung to the coping of the wall got astride of it let themselves slip one after the other along the rope upon a little roof which touches the bath house pulled their rope after them jumped down into the courtyard of the bath house traversed it pushed open the porter s wicket beside which hung his rope pulled this opened the porte cochère and found themselves in the street three quarters of an hour had not elapsed since they had risen in bed in the dark nail in hand and their project in their heads a few moments later they had joined babet and montparnasse who were prowling about the neighborhood they had broken their rope in pulling it after them and a bit of it remained attached to the chimney on the roof they had sustained no other damage however than that of scratching nearly all the skin off their hands that night thénardier was warned without any one being able to explain how and was not asleep towards one o clock in the morning the night being very dark he saw two shadows pass along the roof in the rain and squalls in front of the dormer window which was opposite his cage one halted at the window long enough to dart in a glance this was brujon thénardier recognized him and understood this was enough thénardier rated as a burglar and detained as a measure of precaution under the charge of organizing a nocturnal ambush with armed force was kept in sight the sentry who was relieved every two hours marched up and down in front of his cage with loaded musket the fine air was lighted by a skylight the prisoner had on his feet fetters weighing fifty pounds every day at four o clock in the afternoon a jailer escorted by two dogs this was still in vogue at that time entered his cage deposited beside his bed a loaf of black bread weighing two pounds a jug of water a bowl filled with rather thin bouillon in which swam a few mayagan beans inspected his irons and tapped the bars this man and his dogs made two visits during the night thénardier had obtained permission to keep a sort of iron bolt which he used to spike his bread into a crack in the wall in order to preserve it from the rats as he said as thénardier was kept in sight no objection had been made to this spike still it was remembered afterwards that one of the jailers had said it would be better to let him have only a wooden spike at two o clock in the morning the sentinel who was an old soldier was relieved and replaced by a conscript a few moments later the man with the dogs paid his visit and went off without noticing anything except possibly the excessive youth and the rustic air of the raw recruit two hours afterwards at four o clock when they came to relieve the conscript he was found asleep on the floor lying like a log near thénardier s cage as for thénardier he was no longer there there was a hole in the ceiling of his cage and above it another hole in the roof one of the planks of his bed had been wrenched off and probably carried away with him as it was not found they also seized in his cell a half empty bottle which contained the remains of the stupefying wine with which the soldier had been drugged the soldier s bayonet had disappeared at the moment when this discovery was made it was assumed that thénardier was out of reach the truth is that he was no longer in the new building but that he was still in great danger thénardier on reaching the roof of the new building had found the remains of brujon s rope hanging to the bars of the upper trap of the chimney but as this broken fragment was much too short he had not been able to escape by the outer wall as brujon and guelemer had done when one turns from the rue des ballets into the rue du roi de sicile one almost immediately encounters a repulsive ruin there stood on that spot in the last century a house of which only the back wall now remains a regular wall of masonry which rises to the height of the third story between the adjoining buildings this ruin can be recognized by two large square windows which are still to be seen there the middle one that nearest the right gable is barred with a worm eaten beam adjusted like a prop through these windows there was formerly visible a lofty and lugubrious wall which was a fragment of the outer wall of la force the empty space on the street left by the demolished house is half filled by a fence of rotten boards shored up by five stone posts in this recess lies concealed a little shanty which leans against the portion of the ruin which has remained standing the fence has a gate which a few years ago was fastened only by a latch it was the crest of this ruin that thénardier had succeeded in reaching a little after one o clock in the morning how had he got there that is what no one has ever been able to explain or understand the lightning must at the same time have hindered and helped him had he made use of the ladders and scaffoldings of the slaters to get from roof to roof from enclosure to enclosure from compartment to compartment to the buildings of the charlemagne court then to the buildings of the saint louis court to the outer wall and thence to the hut on the rue du roi de sicile but in that itinerary there existed breaks which seemed to render it an impossibility had he placed the plank from his bed like a bridge from the roof of the fine air to the outer wall and crawled flat on his belly on the coping of the outer wall the whole distance round the prison as far as the hut but the outer wall of la force formed a crenellated and unequal line it mounted and descended it dropped at the firemen s barracks it rose towards the bath house it was cut in twain by buildings it was not even of the same height on the hotel lamoignon as on the rue pavée everywhere occurred falls and right angles and then the sentinels must have espied the dark form of the fugitive hence the route taken by thénardier still remains rather inexplicable in two manners flight was impossible had thénardier spurred on by that thirst for liberty which changes precipices into ditches iron bars into wattles of osier a legless man into an athlete a gouty man into a bird stupidity into instinct instinct into intelligence and intelligence into genius had thénardier invented a third mode no one has ever found out the marvels of escape cannot always be accounted for the man who makes his escape we repeat is inspired there is something of the star and of the lightning in the mysterious gleam of flight the effort towards deliverance is no less surprising than the flight towards the sublime and one says of the escaped thief how did he contrive to scale that wall in the same way that one says of corneille where did he find the means of dying at all events dripping with perspiration drenched with rain with his clothes hanging in ribbons his hands flayed his elbows bleeding his knees torn thénardier had reached what children in their figurative language call the edge of the wall of the ruin there he had stretched himself out at full length and there his strength had failed him a steep escarpment three stories high separated him from the pavement of the street the rope which he had was too short there he waited pale exhausted desperate with all the despair which he had undergone still hidden by the night but telling himself that the day was on the point of dawning alarmed at the idea of hearing the neighboring clock of saint paul strike four within a few minutes an hour when the sentinel was relieved and when the latter would be found asleep under the pierced roof staring in horror at a terrible depth at the light of the street lanterns the wet black pavement that pavement longed for yet frightful which meant death and which meant liberty he asked himself whether his three accomplices in flight had succeeded if they had heard him and if they would come to his assistance he listened with the exception of the patrol no one had passed through the street since he had been there nearly the whole of the descent of the market gardeners from montreuil from charonne from vincennes and from bercy to the markets was accomplished through the rue saint antoine four o clock struck thénardier shuddered a few moments later that terrified and confused uproar which follows the discovery of an escape broke forth in the prison the sound of doors opening and shutting the creaking of gratings on their hinges a tumult in the guard house the hoarse shouts of the turnkeys the shock of musket butts on the pavement of the courts reached his ears lights ascended and descended past the grated windows of the dormitories a torch ran along the ridge pole of the top story of the new building the firemen belonging in the barracks on the right had been summoned their helmets which the torch lighted up in the rain went and came along the roofs at the same time thénardier perceived in the direction of the bastille a wan whiteness lighting up the edge of the sky in doleful wise he was on top of a wall ten inches wide stretched out under the heavy rains with two gulfs to right and left unable to stir subject to the giddiness of a possible fall and to the horror of a certain arrest and his thoughts like the pendulum of a clock swung from one of these ideas to the other dead if i fall caught if i stay in the midst of this anguish he suddenly saw the street being still dark a man who was gliding along the walls and coming from the rue pavée halt in the recess above which thénardier was as it were suspended here this man was joined by a second who walked with the same caution then by a third then by a fourth when these men were re united one of them lifted the latch of the gate in the fence and all four entered the enclosure in which the shanty stood they halted directly under thénardier these men had evidently chosen this vacant space in order that they might consult without being seen by the passers by or by the sentinel who guards the wicket of la force a few paces distant it must be added that the rain kept this sentinel blocked in his box thénardier not being able to distinguish their visages lent an ear to their words with the desperate attention of a wretch who feels himself lost thénardier saw something resembling a gleam of hope flash before his eyes these men conversed in slang the first said in a low but distinct voice let s cut what are we up to here the second replied it s raining hard enough to put out the very devil s fire and the bobbies will be along instanter there s a soldier on guard yonder we shall get nabbed here these two words icigo and icicaille both of which mean ici and which belong the first to the slang of the barriers the second to the slang of the temple were flashes of light for thénardier by the icigo he recognized brujon who was a prowler of the barriers by the icicaille he knew babet who among his other trades had been an old clothes broker at the temple the antique slang of the great century is no longer spoken except in the temple and babet was really the only person who spoke it in all its purity had it not been for the icicaille thénardier would not have recognized him for he had entirely changed his voice in the meanwhile the third man had intervened there s no hurry yet let s wait a bit how do we know that he doesn t stand in need of us by this which was nothing but french thénardier recognized montparnasse who made it a point in his elegance to understand all slangs and to speak none of them as for the fourth he held his peace but his huge shoulders betrayed him thénardier did not hesitate it was guelemer brujon replied almost impetuously but still in a low tone what are you jabbering about the tavern keeper hasn t managed to cut his stick he don t tumble to the racket that he don t you have to be a pretty knowing cove to tear up your shirt cut up your sheet to make a rope punch holes in doors get up false papers make false keys file your irons hang out your cord hide yourself and disguise yourself the old fellow hasn t managed to play it he doesn t understand how to work the business babet added still in that classical slang which was spoken by poulailler and cartouche and which is to the bold new highly colored and risky argot used by brujon what the language of racine is to the language of andré chenier your tavern keeper must have been nabbed in the act you have to be knowing he s only a greenhorn he must have let himself be taken in by a bobby perhaps even by a sheep who played it on him as his pal listen montparnasse do you hear those shouts in the prison you have seen all those lights he s recaptured there he ll get off with twenty years i ain t afraid i ain t a coward but there ain t anything more to do or otherwise they d lead us a dance don t get mad come with us let s go drink a bottle of old wine together one doesn t desert one s friends in a scrape grumbled montparnasse i tell you he s nabbed retorted brujon at the present moment the inn keeper ain t worth a ha penny we can t do nothing for him let s be off every minute i think a bobby has got me in his fist montparnasse no longer offered more than a feeble resistance the fact is that these four men with the fidelity of ruffians who never abandon each other had prowled all night long about la force great as was their peril in the hope of seeing thénardier make his appearance on the top of some wall but the night which was really growing too fine for the downpour was such as to render all the streets deserted the cold which was overpowering them their soaked garments their hole ridden shoes the alarming noise which had just burst forth in the prison the hours which had elapsed the patrol which they had encountered the hope which was vanishing all urged them to beat a retreat montparnasse himself who was perhaps almost thénardier s son in law yielded a moment more and they would be gone thénardier was panting on his wall like the shipwrecked sufferers of the méduse on their raft when they beheld the vessel which had appeared in sight vanish on the horizon he dared not call to them a cry might be heard and ruin everything an idea occurred to him a last idea a flash of inspiration he drew from his pocket the end of brujon s rope which he had detached from the chimney of the new building and flung it into the space enclosed by the fence this rope fell at their feet a widow 37 said babet my tortouse 38 said brujon the tavern keeper is there said montparnasse they raised their eyes thénardier thrust out his head a very little quick said montparnasse have you the other end of the rope brujon yes knot the two pieces together we ll fling him the rope he can fasten it to the wall and he ll have enough of it to get down with thénardier ran the risk and spoke i am paralyzed with cold we ll warm you up i can t budge let yourself slide we ll catch you my hands are benumbed only fasten the rope to the wall i can t then one of us must climb up said montparnasse three stories ejaculated brujon an ancient plaster flue which had served for a stove that had been used in the shanty in former times ran along the wall and mounted almost to the very spot where they could see thénardier this flue then much damaged and full of cracks has since fallen but the marks of it are still visible it was very narrow one might get up by the help of that said montparnasse by that flue exclaimed babet a grown up cove never it would take a brat a brat must be got resumed brujon where are we to find a young un said guelemer wait said montparnasse i ve got the very article he opened the gate of the fence very softly made sure that no one was passing along the street stepped out cautiously shut the gate behind him and set off at a run in the direction of the bastille seven or eight minutes elapsed eight thousand centuries to thénardier babet brujon and guelemer did not open their lips at last the gate opened once more and montparnasse appeared breathless and followed by gavroche the rain still rendered the street completely deserted little gavroche entered the enclosure and gazed at the forms of these ruffians with a tranquil air the water was dripping from his hair guelemer addressed him are you a man young un gavroche shrugged his shoulders and replied a young un like me s a man and men like you are babes the brat s tongue s well hung exclaimed babet the paris brat ain t made of straw added brujon what do you want asked gavroche montparnasse answered climb up that flue with this rope said babet and fasten it continued brujon to the top of the wall went on babet to the cross bar of the window added brujon and then said gavroche there said guelemer the gamin examined the rope the flue the wall the windows and made that indescribable and disdainful noise with his lips which signifies is that all there s a man up there whom you are to save resumed montparnasse will you began brujon again greenhorn replied the lad as though the question appeared a most unprecedented one to him and he took off his shoes guelemer seized gavroche by one arm set him on the roof of the shanty whose worm eaten planks bent beneath the urchin s weight and handed him the rope which brujon had knotted together during montparnasse s absence the gamin directed his steps towards the flue which it was easy to enter thanks to a large crack which touched the roof at the moment when he was on the point of ascending thénardier who saw life and safety approaching bent over the edge of the wall the first light of dawn struck white upon his brow dripping with sweat upon his livid cheek bones his sharp and savage nose his bristling gray beard and gavroche recognized him hullo it s my father oh that won t hinder and taking the rope in his teeth he resolutely began the ascent he reached the summit of the hut bestrode the old wall as though it had been a horse and knotted the rope firmly to the upper cross bar of the window a moment later thénardier was in the street as soon as he touched the pavement as soon as he found himself out of danger he was no longer either weary or chilled or trembling the terrible things from which he had escaped vanished like smoke all that strange and ferocious mind awoke once more and stood erect and free ready to march onward these were this man s first words now whom are we to eat it is useless to explain the sense of this frightfully transparent remark which signifies both to kill to assassinate and to plunder to eat true sense to devour let s get well into a corner said brujon let s settle it in three words and part at once there was an affair that promised well in the rue plumet a deserted street an isolated house an old rotten gate on a garden and lone women well why not demanded thénardier your girl éponine went to see about the matter replied babet and she brought a biscuit to magnon added guelemer nothing to be made there the girl s no fool said thénardier still it must be seen to yes yes said brujon it must be looked up in the meanwhile none of the men seemed to see gavroche who during this colloquy had seated himself on one of the fence posts he waited a few moments thinking that perhaps his father would turn towards him then he put on his shoes again and said is that all you don t want any more my men now you re out of your scrape i m off i must go and get my brats out of bed and off he went the five men emerged one after another from the enclosure when gavroche had disappeared at the corner of the rue des ballets babet took thénardier aside did you take a good look at that young un he asked what young un the one who climbed the wall and carried you the rope not particularly well i don t know but it strikes me that it was your son bah said thénardier do you think so book seventh slang enlarge chapter i origin pigritia is a terrible word it engenders a whole world la pègre for which read theft and a hell la pègrenne for which read hunger thus idleness is the mother she has a son theft and a daughter hunger where are we at this moment in the land of slang what is slang it is at one and the same time a nation and a dialect it is theft in its two kinds people and language when four and thirty years ago the narrator of this grave and sombre history introduced into a work written with the same aim as this39 a thief who talked argot there arose amazement and clamor what how argot why argot is horrible it is the language of prisons galleys convicts of everything that is most abominable in society etc etc we have never understood this sort of objections since that time two powerful romancers one of whom is a profound observer of the human heart the other an intrepid friend of the people balzac and eugène sue having represented their ruffians as talking their natural language as the author of the last day of a condemned man did in 1828 the same objections have been raised people repeated what do authors mean by that revolting dialect slang is odious slang makes one shudder who denies that of course it does when it is a question of probing a wound a gulf a society since when has it been considered wrong to go too far to go to the bottom we have always thought that it was sometimes a courageous act and at least a simple and useful deed worthy of the sympathetic attention which duty accepted and fulfilled merits why should one not explore everything and study everything why should one halt on the way the halt is a matter depending on the sounding line and not on the leadsman certainly too it is neither an attractive nor an easy task to undertake an investigation into the lowest depths of the social order where terra firma comes to an end and where mud begins to rummage in those vague murky waves to follow up to seize and to fling still quivering upon the pavement that abject dialect which is dripping with filth when thus brought to the light that pustulous vocabulary each word of which seems an unclean ring from a monster of the mire and the shadows nothing is more lugubrious than the contemplation thus in its nudity in the broad light of thought of the horrible swarming of slang it seems in fact to be a sort of horrible beast made for the night which has just been torn from its cesspool one thinks one beholds a frightful living and bristling thicket which quivers rustles wavers returns to shadow threatens and glares one word resembles a claw another an extinguished and bleeding eye such and such a phrase seems to move like the claw of a crab all this is alive with the hideous vitality of things which have been organized out of disorganization now when has horror ever excluded study since when has malady banished medicine can one imagine a naturalist refusing to study the viper the bat the scorpion the centipede the tarantula and one who would cast them back into their darkness saying oh how ugly that is the thinker who should turn aside from slang would resemble a surgeon who should avert his face from an ulcer or a wart he would be like a philologist refusing to examine a fact in language a philosopher hesitating to scrutinize a fact in humanity for it must be stated to those who are ignorant of the case that argot is both a literary phenomenon and a social result what is slang properly speaking it is the language of wretchedness we may be stopped the fact may be put to us in general terms which is one way of attenuating it we may be told that all trades professions it may be added all the accidents of the social hierarchy and all forms of intelligence have their own slang the merchant who says montpellier not active marseilles fine quality the broker on change who says assets at end of current month the gambler who says tiers et tout refait de pique the sheriff of the norman isles who says the holder in fee reverting to his landed estate cannot claim the fruits of that estate during the hereditary seizure of the real estate by the mortgagor the playwright who says the piece was hissed the comedian who says i ve made a hit the philosopher who says phenomenal triplicity the huntsman who says voileci allais voileci fuyant the phrenologist who says amativeness combativeness secretiveness the infantry soldier who says my shooting iron the cavalry man who says my turkey cock the fencing master who says tierce quarte break the printer who says my shooting stick and galley all printer fencing master cavalry dragoon infantry man phrenologist huntsman philosopher comedian playwright sheriff gambler stock broker and merchant speak slang the painter who says my grinder the notary who says my skip the gutter the hairdresser who says my mealyback the cobbler who says my cub talks slang strictly speaking if one absolutely insists on the point all the different fashions of saying the right and the left the sailor s port and starboard the scene shifter s court side and garden side the beadle s gospel side and epistle side are slang there is the slang of the affected lady as well as of the précieuses the hotel rambouillet nearly adjoins the cour des miracles there is a slang of duchesses witness this phrase contained in a love letter from a very great lady and a very pretty woman of the restoration you will find in this gossip a fultitude of reasons why i should libertize 40 diplomatic ciphers are slang the pontifical chancellery by using 26 for rome grkztntgzyal for despatch and abfxustgrnogrkzu tu xi for the duc de modena speaks slang the physicians of the middle ages who for carrot radish and turnip said opoponach perfroschinum reptitalmus dracatholicum angelorum postmegorum talked slang the sugar manufacturer who says loaf clarified lumps bastard common burnt this honest manufacturer talks slang a certain school of criticism twenty years ago which used to say half of the works of shakespeare consists of plays upon words and puns talked slang the poet and the artist who with profound understanding would designate m de montmorency as a bourgeois if he were not a judge of verses and statues speak slang the classic academician who calls flowers flora fruits pomona the sea neptune love fires beauty charms a horse a courser the white or tricolored cockade the rose of bellona the three cornered hat mars triangle that classical academician talks slang algebra medicine botany have each their slang the tongue which is employed on board ship that wonderful language of the sea which is so complete and so picturesque which was spoken by jean bart duquesne suffren and duperré which mingles with the whistling of the rigging the sound of the speaking trumpets the shock of the boarding irons the roll of the sea the wind the gale the cannon is wholly a heroic and dazzling slang which is to the fierce slang of the thieves what the lion is to the jackal no doubt but say what we will this manner of understanding the word slang is an extension which every one will not admit for our part we reserve to the word its ancient and precise circumscribed and determined significance and we restrict slang to slang the veritable slang and the slang that is pre eminently slang if the two words can be coupled thus the slang immemorial which was a kingdom is nothing else we repeat than the homely uneasy crafty treacherous venomous cruel equivocal vile profound fatal tongue of wretchedness there exists at the extremity of all abasement and all misfortunes a last misery which revolts and makes up its mind to enter into conflict with the whole mass of fortunate facts and reigning rights a fearful conflict where now cunning now violent unhealthy and ferocious at one and the same time it attacks the social order with pin pricks through vice and with club blows through crime to meet the needs of this conflict wretchedness has invented a language of combat which is slang to keep afloat and to rescue from oblivion to hold above the gulf were it but a fragment of some language which man has spoken and which would otherwise be lost that is to say one of the elements good or bad of which civilization is composed or by which it is complicated to extend the records of social observation is to serve civilization itself this service plautus rendered consciously or unconsciously by making two carthaginian soldiers talk phonician that service molière rendered by making so many of his characters talk levantine and all sorts of dialects here objections spring up afresh phonician very good levantine quite right even dialect let that pass they are tongues which have belonged to nations or provinces but slang what is the use of preserving slang what is the good of assisting slang to survive to this we reply in one word only assuredly if the tongue which a nation or a province has spoken is worthy of interest the language which has been spoken by a misery is still more worthy of attention and study it is the language which has been spoken in france for example for more than four centuries not only by a misery but by every possible human misery and then we insist upon it the study of social deformities and infirmities and the task of pointing them out with a view to remedy is not a business in which choice is permitted the historian of manners and ideas has no less austere a mission than the historian of events the latter has the surface of civilization the conflicts of crowns the births of princes the marriages of kings battles assemblages great public men revolutions in the daylight everything on the exterior the other historian has the interior the depths the people who toil suffer wait the oppressed woman the agonizing child the secret war between man and man obscure ferocities prejudices plotted iniquities the subterranean the indistinct tremors of multitudes the die of hunger the counter blows of the law the secret evolution of souls the go bare foot the bare armed the disinherited the orphans the unhappy and the infamous all the forms which roam through the darkness he must descend with his heart full of charity and severity at the same time as a brother and as a judge to those impenetrable casemates where crawl pell mell those who bleed and those who deal the blow those who weep and those who curse those who fast and those who devour those who endure evil and those who inflict it have these historians of hearts and souls duties at all inferior to the historians of external facts does any one think that alighieri has any fewer things to say than machiavelli is the under side of civilization any less important than the upper side merely because it is deeper and more sombre do we really know the mountain well when we are not acquainted with the cavern let us say moreover parenthetically that from a few words of what precedes a marked separation might be inferred between the two classes of historians which does not exist in our mind no one is a good historian of the patent visible striking and public life of peoples if he is not at the same time in a certain measure the historian of their deep and hidden life and no one is a good historian of the interior unless he understands how at need to be the historian of the exterior also the history of manners and ideas permeates the history of events and this is true reciprocally they constitute two different orders of facts which correspond to each other which are always interlaced and which often bring forth results all the lineaments which providence traces on the surface of a nation have their parallels sombre but distinct in their depths and all convulsions of the depths produce ebullitions on the surface true history being a mixture of all things the true historian mingles in everything man is not a circle with a single centre he is an ellipse with a double focus facts form one of these and ideas the other slang is nothing but a dressing room where the tongue having some bad action to perform disguises itself there it clothes itself in word masks in metaphor rags in this guise it becomes horrible one finds it difficult to recognize is it really the french tongue the great human tongue behold it ready to step upon the stage and to retort upon crime and prepared for all the employments of the repertory of evil it no longer walks it hobbles it limps on the crutch of the court of miracles a crutch metamorphosable into a club it is called vagrancy every sort of spectre its dressers have painted its face it crawls and rears the double gait of the reptile henceforth it is apt at all rôles it is made suspicious by the counterfeiter covered with verdigris by the forger blacked by the soot of the incendiary and the murderer applies its rouge when one listens by the side of honest men at the portals of society one overhears the dialogues of those who are on the outside one distinguishes questions and replies one perceives without understanding it a hideous murmur sounding almost like human accents but more nearly resembling a howl than an articulate word it is slang the words are misshapen and stamped with an indescribable and fantastic bestiality one thinks one hears hydras talking it is unintelligible in the dark it gnashes and whispers completing the gloom with mystery it is black in misfortune it is blacker still in crime these two blacknesses amalgamated compose slang obscurity in the atmosphere obscurity in acts obscurity in voices terrible toad like tongue which goes and comes leaps crawls slobbers and stirs about in monstrous wise in that immense gray fog composed of rain and night of hunger of vice of falsehood of injustice of nudity of suffocation and of winter the high noonday of the miserable let us have compassion on the chastised alas who are we ourselves who am i who now address you who are you who are listening to me and are you very sure that we have done nothing before we were born the earth is not devoid of resemblance to a jail who knows whether man is not a recaptured offender against divine justice look closely at life it is so made that everywhere we feel the sense of punishment are you what is called a happy man well you are sad every day each day has its own great grief or its little care yesterday you were trembling for a health that is dear to you to day you fear for your own to morrow it will be anxiety about money the day after to morrow the diatribe of a slanderer the day after that the misfortune of some friend then the prevailing weather then something that has been broken or lost then a pleasure with which your conscience and your vertebral column reproach you again the course of public affairs this without reckoning in the pains of the heart and so it goes on one cloud is dispelled another forms there is hardly one day out of a hundred which is wholly joyous and sunny and you belong to that small class who are happy as for the rest of mankind stagnating night rests upon them thoughtful minds make but little use of the phrase the fortunate and the unfortunate in this world evidently the vestibule of another there are no fortunate the real human division is this the luminous and the shady to diminish the number of the shady to augment the number of the luminous that is the object that is why we cry education science to teach reading means to light the fire every syllable spelled out sparkles however he who says light does not necessarily say joy people suffer in the light excess burns the flame is the enemy of the wing to burn without ceasing to fly therein lies the marvel of genius when you shall have learned to know and to love you will still suffer the day is born in tears the luminous weep if only over those in darkness chapter ii roots slang is the tongue of those who sit in darkness thought is moved in its most sombre depths social philosophy is bidden to its most poignant meditations in the presence of that enigmatic dialect at once so blighted and rebellious therein lies chastisement made visible every syllable has an air of being marked the words of the vulgar tongue appear therein wrinkled and shrivelled as it were beneath the hot iron of the executioner some seem to be still smoking such and such a phrase produces upon you the effect of the shoulder of a thief branded with the fleur de lys which has suddenly been laid bare ideas almost refuse to be expressed in these substantives which are fugitives from justice metaphor is sometimes so shameless that one feels that it has worn the iron neck fetter moreover in spite of all this and because of all this this strange dialect has by rights its own compartment in that great impartial case of pigeon holes where there is room for the rusty farthing as well as for the gold medal and which is called literature slang whether the public admit the fact or not has its syntax and its poetry it is a language yes by the deformity of certain terms we recognize the fact that it was chewed by mandrin and by the splendor of certain metonymies we feel that villon spoke it that exquisite and celebrated verse mais où sont les neiges d antan but where are the snows of years gone by is a verse of slang antam ante annum is a word of thunes slang which signified the past year and by extension formerly thirty five years ago at the epoch of the departure of the great chain gang there could be read in one of the cells at bicêtre this maxim engraved with a nail on the wall by a king of thunes condemned to the galleys les dabs d antan trimaient siempre pour la pierre du coësre this means kings in days gone by always went and had themselves anointed in the opinion of that king anointment meant the galleys the word décarade which expresses the departure of heavy vehicles at a gallop is attributed to villon and it is worthy of him this word which strikes fire with all four of its feet sums up in a masterly onomatopoia the whole of la fontaine s admirable verse six forts chevaux tiraient un coche six stout horses drew a coach from a purely literary point of view few studies would prove more curious and fruitful than the study of slang it is a whole language within a language a sort of sickly excrescence an unhealthy graft which has produced a vegetation a parasite which has its roots in the old gallic trunk and whose sinister foliage crawls all over one side of the language this is what may be called the first the vulgar aspect of slang but for those who study the tongue as it should be studied that is to say as geologists study the earth slang appears like a veritable alluvial deposit according as one digs a longer or shorter distance into it one finds in slang below the old popular french provençal spanish italian levantine that language of the mediterranean ports english and german the romance language in its three varieties french italian and romance romance latin and finally basque and celtic a profound and unique formation a subterranean edifice erected in common by all the miserable each accursed race has deposited its layer each suffering has dropped its stone there each heart has contributed its pebble a throng of evil base or irritated souls who have traversed life and have vanished into eternity linger there almost entirely visible still beneath the form of some monstrous word do you want spanish the old gothic slang

affurer to steal fur cadene chain catena there is one word which crops up in every language of the continent with a sort of mysterious power and authority it is the word magnus the scotchman makes of it his mac which designates the chief of the clan mac farlane mac callumore the great farlane the great callumore41 slang turns it into meck and later le meg that is to say god would you like basque

finally would you like history slang calls crowns les maltèses a souvenir of the coin in circulation on the galleys of malta in addition to the philological origins just indicated slang possesses other and still more natural roots which spring so to speak from the mind of man itself in the first place the direct creation of words therein lies the mystery of tongues to paint with words which contains figures one knows not how or why is the primitive foundation of all human languages what may be called their granite slang abounds in words of this description immediate words words created instantaneously no one knows either where or by whom without etymology without analogies without derivatives solitary barbarous sometimes hideous words which at times possess a singular power of expression and which live the executioner le taule the forest le sabri fear flight taf the lackey le larbin the mineral the prefect the minister pharos the devil le rabouin nothing is stranger than these words which both mask and reveal some le rabouin for example are at the same time grotesque and terrible and produce on you the effect of a cyclopean grimace in the second place metaphor the peculiarity of a language which is desirous of saying all yet concealing all is that it is rich in figures metaphor is an enigma wherein the thief who is plotting a stroke the prisoner who is arranging an escape take refuge no idiom is more metaphorical than slang dévisser le coco to unscrew the nut to twist the neck tortiller to wriggle to eat être gerbé to be tried a rat a bread thief il lansquine it rains a striking ancient figure which partly bears its date about it which assimilates long oblique lines of rain with the dense and slanting pikes of the lancers and which compresses into a single word the popular expression it rains halberds sometimes in proportion as slang progresses from the first epoch to the second words pass from the primitive and savage sense to the metaphorical sense the devil ceases to be le rabouin and becomes le boulanger the baker who puts the bread into the oven this is more witty but less grand something like racine after corneille like euripides after æschylus certain slang phrases which participate in the two epochs and have at once the barbaric character and the metaphorical character resemble phantasmagories les sorgueuers vont solliciter des gails à la lune the prowlers are going to steal horses by night this passes before the mind like a group of spectres one knows not what one sees in the third place the expedient slang lives on the language it uses it in accordance with its fancy it dips into it hap hazard and it often confines itself when occasion arises to alter it in a gross and summary fashion occasionally with the ordinary words thus deformed and complicated with words of pure slang picturesque phrases are formed in which there can be felt the mixture of the two preceding elements the direct creation and the metaphor le cab jaspine je marronne que la roulotte de pantin trime dans le sabri the dog is barking i suspect that the diligence for paris is passing through the woods le dab est sinve la dabuge est merloussière la fée est bative the bourgeois is stupid the bourgeoise is cunning the daughter is pretty generally to throw listeners off the track slang confines itself to adding to all the words of the language without distinction an ignoble tail a termination in aille in orgue in iergue or in uche thus vousiergue trouvaille bonorgue ce gigotmuche do you think that leg of mutton good a phrase addressed by cartouche to a turnkey in order to find out whether the sum offered for his escape suited him the termination in mar has been added recently slang being the dialect of corruption quickly becomes corrupted itself besides this as it is always seeking concealment as soon as it feels that it is understood it changes its form contrary to what happens with every other vegetation every ray of light which falls upon it kills whatever it touches thus slang is in constant process of decomposition and recomposition an obscure and rapid work which never pauses it passes over more ground in ten years than a language in ten centuries thus le larton bread becomes le lartif le gail horse becomes le gaye la fertanche straw becomes la fertille le momignard brat le momacque les fiques duds frusques la chique the church l égrugeoir le colabre neck le colas the devil is at first gahisto then le rabouin then the baker the priest is a ratichon then the boar le sanglier the dagger is le vingt deux twenty two then le surin then le lingre the police are railles then roussins then rousses then marchands de lacets dealers in stay laces then coquers then cognes the executioner is le taule then charlot l atigeur then le becquillard in the seventeenth century to fight was to give each other snuff in the nineteenth it is to chew each other s throats there have been twenty different phrases between these two extremes cartouche s talk would have been hebrew to lacenaire all the words of this language are perpetually engaged in flight like the men who utter them still from time to time and in consequence of this very movement the ancient slang crops up again and becomes new once more it has its headquarters where it maintains its sway the temple preserved the slang of the seventeenth century bicêtre when it was a prison preserved the slang of thunes there one could hear the termination in anche of the old thuneurs boyanches tu bois tu do you drink but perpetual movement remains its law nevertheless if the philosopher succeeds in fixing for a moment for purposes of observation this language which is incessantly evaporating he falls into doleful and useful meditation no study is more efficacious and more fecund in instruction there is not a metaphor not an analogy in slang which does not contain a lesson among these men to beat means to feign one beats a malady ruse is their strength for them the idea of the man is not separated from the idea of darkness the night is called la sorgue man l orgue man is a derivative of the night they have taken up the practice of considering society in the light of an atmosphere which kills them of a fatal force and they speak of their liberty as one would speak of his health a man under arrest is a sick man one who is condemned is a dead man the most terrible thing for the prisoner within the four walls in which he is buried is a sort of glacial chastity and he calls the dungeon the castus in that funereal place life outside always presents itself under its most smiling aspect the prisoner has irons on his feet you think perhaps that his thought is that it is with the feet that one walks no he is thinking that it is with the feet that one dances so when he has succeeded in severing his fetters his first idea is that now he can dance and he calls the saw the bastringue public house ball a name is a centre profound assimilation the ruffian has two heads one of which reasons out his actions and leads him all his life long and the other which he has upon his shoulders on the day of his death he calls the head which counsels him in crime la sorbonne and the head which expiates it la tronche when a man has no longer anything but rags upon his body and vices in his heart when he has arrived at that double moral and material degradation which the word blackguard characterizes in its two acceptations he is ripe for crime he is like a well whetted knife he has two cutting edges his distress and his malice so slang does not say a blackguard it says un réguisé what are the galleys a brazier of damnation a hell the convict calls himself a fagot and finally what name do malefactors give to their prison the college a whole penitentiary system can be evolved from that word does the reader wish to know where the majority of the songs of the galleys those refrains called in the special vocabulary lirlonfa have had their birth let him listen to what follows there existed at the châtelet in paris a large and long cellar this cellar was eight feet below the level of the seine it had neither windows nor air holes its only aperture was the door men could enter there air could not this vault had for ceiling a vault of stone and for floor ten inches of mud it was flagged but the pavement had rotted and cracked under the oozing of the water eight feet above the floor a long and massive beam traversed this subterranean excavation from side to side from this beam hung at short distances apart chains three feet long and at the end of these chains there were rings for the neck in this vault men who had been condemned to the galleys were incarcerated until the day of their departure for toulon they were thrust under this beam where each one found his fetters swinging in the darkness and waiting for him the chains those pendant arms and the necklets those open hands caught the unhappy wretches by the throat they were rivetted and left there as the chain was too short they could not lie down they remained motionless in that cavern in that night beneath that beam almost hanging forced to unheard of efforts to reach their bread jug or their vault overhead mud even to mid leg filth flowing to their very calves broken asunder with fatigue with thighs and knees giving way clinging fast to the chain with their hands in order to obtain some rest unable to sleep except when standing erect and awakened every moment by the strangling of the collar some woke no more in order to eat they pushed the bread which was flung to them in the mud along their leg with their heel until it reached their hand how long did they remain thus one month two months six months sometimes one stayed a year it was the antechamber of the galleys men were put there for stealing a hare from the king in this sepulchre hell what did they do what man can do in a sepulchre they went through the agonies of death and what can man do in hell they sang for song lingers where there is no longer any hope in the waters of malta when a galley was approaching the song could be heard before the sound of the oars poor survincent the poacher who had gone through the prison cellar of the châtelet said it was the rhymes that kept me up uselessness of poetry what is the good of rhyme it is in this cellar that nearly all the slang songs had their birth it is from the dungeon of the grand châtelet of paris that comes the melancholy refrain of the montgomery galley timaloumisaine timaloumison the majority of these songs are melancholy some are gay one is tender icicaille est la theatre here is the theatre du petit dardant of the little archer cupid do what you will you cannot annihilate that eternal relic in the heart of man love in this world of dismal deeds people keep their secrets the secret is the thing above all others the secret in the eyes of these wretches is unity which serves as a base of union to betray a secret is to tear from each member of this fierce community something of his own personality to inform against in the energetic slang dialect is called to eat the bit as though the informer drew to himself a little of the substance of all and nourished himself on a bit of each one s flesh what does it signify to receive a box on the ear commonplace metaphor replies it is to see thirty six candles here slang intervenes and takes it up candle camoufle thereupon the ordinary tongue gives camouflet 42 as the synonym for soufflet thus by a sort of infiltration from below upwards with the aid of metaphor that incalculable trajectory slang mounts from the cavern to the academy and poulailler saying i light my camoufle causes voltaire to write langleviel la beaumelle deserves a hundred camouflets researches in slang mean discoveries at every step study and investigation of this strange idiom lead to the mysterious point of intersection of regular society with society which is accursed the thief also has his food for cannon stealable matter you i whoever passes by le pantre pan everybody slang is language turned convict that the thinking principle of man be thrust down ever so low that it can be dragged and pinioned there by obscure tyrannies of fatality that it can be bound by no one knows what fetters in that abyss is sufficient to create consternation oh poor thought of miserable wretches alas will no one come to the succor of the human soul in that darkness is it her destiny there to await forever the mind the liberator the immense rider of pegasi and hippogriffs the combatant of heroes of the dawn who shall descend from the azure between two wings the radiant knight of the future will she forever summon in vain to her assistance the lance of light of the ideal is she condemned to hear the fearful approach of evil through the density of the gulf and to catch glimpses nearer and nearer at hand beneath the hideous water of that dragon s head that maw streaked with foam and that writhing undulation of claws swellings and rings must it remain there without a gleam of light without hope given over to that terrible approach vaguely scented out by the monster shuddering dishevelled wringing its arms forever chained to the rock of night a sombre andromeda white and naked amid the shadows chapter iii slang which weeps and slang which laughs as the reader perceives slang in its entirety slang of four hundred years ago like the slang of to day is permeated with that sombre symbolical spirit which gives to all words a mien which is now mournful now menacing one feels in it the wild and ancient sadness of those vagrants of the court of miracles who played at cards with packs of their own some of which have come down to us the eight of clubs for instance represented a huge tree bearing eight enormous trefoil leaves a sort of fantastic personification of the forest at the foot of this tree a fire was burning over which three hares were roasting a huntsman on a spit and behind him on another fire hung a steaming pot whence emerged the head of a dog nothing can be more melancholy than these reprisals in painting by a pack of cards in the presence of stakes for the roasting of smugglers and of the cauldron for the boiling of counterfeiters the diverse forms assumed by thought in the realm of slang even song even raillery even menace all partook of this powerless and dejected character all the songs the melodies of some of which have been collected were humble and lamentable to the point of evoking tears the pègre is always the poor pègre and he is always the hare in hiding the fugitive mouse the flying bird he hardly complains he contents himself with sighing one of his moans has come down to us i do not understand how god the father of men can torture his children and his grandchildren and hear them cry without himself suffering torture 43 the wretch whenever he has time to think makes himself small before the low and frail in the presence of society he lies down flat on his face he entreats he appeals to the side of compassion we feel that he is conscious of his guilt towards the middle of the last century a change took place prison songs and thieves ritournelles assumed so to speak an insolent and jovial mien the plaintive maluré was replaced by the larifla we find in the eighteenth century in nearly all the songs of the galleys and prisons a diabolical and enigmatical gayety we hear this strident and lilting refrain which we should say had been lighted up by a phosphorescent gleam and which seems to have been flung into the forest by a will o the wisp playing the fife miralabi suslababo mirliton ribonribette surlababi mirlababo mirliton ribonribo this was sung in a cellar or in a nook of the forest while cutting a man s throat a serious symptom in the eighteenth century the ancient melancholy of the dejected classes vanishes they began to laugh they rally the grand meg and the grand dab given louis xv they call the king of france le marquis de pantin and behold they are almost gay a sort of gleam proceeds from these miserable wretches as though their consciences were not heavy within them any more these lamentable tribes of darkness have no longer merely the desperate audacity of actions they possess the heedless audacity of mind a sign that they are losing the sense of their criminality and that they feel even among thinkers and dreamers some indefinable support which the latter themselves know not of a sign that theft and pillage are beginning to filter into doctrines and sophisms in such a way as to lose somewhat of their ugliness while communicating much of it to sophisms and doctrines a sign in short of some outbreak which is prodigious and near unless some diversion shall arise let us pause a moment whom are we accusing here is it the eighteenth century is it philosophy certainly not the work of the eighteenth century is healthy and good and wholesome the encyclopedists diderot at their head the physiocrates turgot at their head the philosophers voltaire at their head the utopians rousseau at their head these are four sacred legions humanity s immense advance towards the light is due to them they are the four vanguards of the human race marching towards the four cardinal points of progress diderot towards the beautiful turgot towards the useful voltaire towards the true rousseau towards the just but by the side of and above the philosophers there were the sophists a venomous vegetation mingled with a healthy growth hemlock in the virgin forest while the executioner was burning the great books of the liberators of the century on the grand staircase of the court house writers now forgotten were publishing with the king s sanction no one knows what strangely disorganizing writings which were eagerly read by the unfortunate some of these publications odd to say which were patronized by a prince are to be found in the secret library these facts significant but unknown were imperceptible on the surface sometimes in the very obscurity of a fact lurks its danger it is obscure because it is underhand of all these writers the one who probably then excavated in the masses the most unhealthy gallery was restif de la bretonne this work peculiar to the whole of europe effected more ravages in germany than anywhere else in germany during a given period summed up by schiller in his famous drama the robbers theft and pillage rose up in protest against property and labor assimilated certain specious and false elementary ideas which though just in appearance were absurd in reality enveloped themselves in these ideas disappeared within them after a fashion assumed an abstract name passed into the state of theory and in that shape circulated among the laborious suffering and honest masses unknown even to the imprudent chemists who had prepared the mixture unknown even to the masses who accepted it whenever a fact of this sort presents itself the case is grave suffering engenders wrath and while the prosperous classes blind themselves or fall asleep which is the same thing as shutting one s eyes the hatred of the unfortunate classes lights its torch at some aggrieved or ill made spirit which dreams in a corner and sets itself to the scrutiny of society the scrutiny of hatred is a terrible thing hence if the ill fortune of the times so wills it those fearful commotions which were formerly called jacqueries beside which purely political agitations are the merest child s play which are no longer the conflict of the oppressed and the oppressor but the revolt of discomfort against comfort then everything crumbles jacqueries are earthquakes of the people it is this peril possibly imminent towards the close of the eighteenth century which the french revolution that immense act of probity cut short the french revolution which is nothing else than the idea armed with the sword rose erect and with the same abrupt movement closed the door of ill and opened the door of good it put a stop to torture promulgated the truth expelled miasma rendered the century healthy crowned the populace it may be said of it that it created man a second time by giving him a second soul the right the nineteenth century has inherited and profited by its work and to day the social catastrophe to which we lately alluded is simply impossible blind is he who announces it foolish is he who fears it revolution is the vaccine of jacquerie thanks to the revolution social conditions have changed feudal and monarchical maladies no longer run in our blood there is no more of the middle ages in our constitution we no longer live in the days when terrible swarms within made irruptions when one heard beneath his feet the obscure course of a dull rumble when indescribable elevations from mole like tunnels appeared on the surface of civilization where the soil cracked open where the roofs of caverns yawned and where one suddenly beheld monstrous heads emerging from the earth the revolutionary sense is a moral sense the sentiment of right once developed develops the sentiment of duty the law of all is liberty which ends where the liberty of others begins according to robespierre s admirable definition since 89 the whole people has been dilating into a sublime individual there is not a poor man who possessing his right has not his ray of sun the die of hunger feels within him the honesty of france the dignity of the citizen is an internal armor he who is free is scrupulous he who votes reigns hence incorruptibility hence the miscarriage of unhealthy lusts hence eyes heroically lowered before temptations the revolutionary wholesomeness is such that on a day of deliverance a 14th of july a 10th of august there is no longer any populace the first cry of the enlightened and increasing throngs is death to thieves progress is an honest man the ideal and the absolute do not filch pocket handkerchiefs by whom were the wagons containing the wealth of the tuileries escorted in 1848 by the rag pickers of the faubourg saint antoine rags mounted guard over the treasure virtue rendered these tatterdemalions resplendent in those wagons in chests hardly closed and some even half open amid a hundred dazzling caskets was that ancient crown of france studded with diamonds surmounted by the carbuncle of royalty by the regent diamond which was worth thirty millions barefooted they guarded that crown hence no more jacquerie i regret it for the sake of the skilful the old fear has produced its last effects in that quarter and henceforth it can no longer be employed in politics the principal spring of the red spectre is broken every one knows it now the scare crow scares no longer the birds take liberties with the mannikin foul creatures alight upon it the bourgeois laugh at it chapter iv the two duties to watch and to hope this being the case is all social danger dispelled certainly not there is no jacquerie society may rest assured on that point blood will no longer rush to its head but let society take heed to the manner in which it breathes apoplexy is no longer to be feared but phthisis is there social phthisis is called misery one can perish from being undermined as well as from being struck by lightning let us not weary of repeating and sympathetic souls must not forget that this is the first of fraternal obligations and selfish hearts must understand that the first of political necessities consists in thinking first of all of the disinherited and sorrowing throngs in solacing airing enlightening loving them in enlarging their horizon to a magnificent extent in lavishing upon them education in every form in offering them the example of labor never the example of idleness in diminishing the individual burden by enlarging the notion of the universal aim in setting a limit to poverty without setting a limit to wealth in creating vast fields of public and popular activity in having like briareus a hundred hands to extend in all directions to the oppressed and the feeble in employing the collective power for that grand duty of opening workshops for all arms schools for all aptitudes and laboratories for all degrees of intelligence in augmenting salaries diminishing trouble balancing what should be and what is that is to say in proportioning enjoyment to effort and a glut to need in a word in evolving from the social apparatus more light and more comfort for the benefit of those who suffer and those who are ignorant and let us say it all this is but the beginning the true question is this labor cannot be a law without being a right we will not insist upon this point this is not the proper place for that if nature calls itself providence society should call itself foresight intellectual and moral growth is no less indispensable than material improvement to know is a sacrament to think is the prime necessity truth is nourishment as well as grain a reason which fasts from science and wisdom grows thin let us enter equal complaint against stomachs and minds which do not eat if there is anything more heart breaking than a body perishing for lack of bread it is a soul which is dying from hunger for the light the whole of progress tends in the direction of solution some day we shall be amazed as the human race mounts upward the deep layers emerge naturally from the zone of distress the obliteration of misery will be accomplished by a simple elevation of level we should do wrong were we to doubt this blessed consummation the past is very strong it is true at the present moment it censures this rejuvenation of a corpse is surprising behold it is walking and advancing it seems a victor this dead body is a conqueror he arrives with his legions superstitions with his sword despotism with his banner ignorance a while ago he won ten battles he advances he threatens he laughs he is at our doors let us not despair on our side let us sell the field on which hannibal is encamped what have we to fear we who believe no such thing as a back flow of ideas exists any more than there exists a return of a river on its course but let those who do not desire a future reflect on this matter when they say no to progress it is not the future but themselves that they are condemning they are giving themselves a sad malady they are inoculating themselves with the past there is but one way of rejecting to morrow and that is to die now no death that of the body as late as possible that of the soul never this is what we desire yes the enigma will utter its word the sphinx will speak the problem will be solved yes the people sketched out by the eighteenth century will be finished by the nineteenth he who doubts this is an idiot the future blossoming the near blossoming forth of universal well being is a divinely fatal phenomenon immense combined propulsions direct human affairs and conduct them within a given time to a logical state that is to say to a state of equilibrium that is to say to equity a force composed of earth and heaven results from humanity and governs it this force is a worker of miracles marvellous issues are no more difficult to it than extraordinary vicissitudes aided by science which comes from one man and by the event which comes from another it is not greatly alarmed by these contradictions in the attitude of problems which seem impossibilities to the vulgar herd it is no less skilful at causing a solution to spring forth from the reconciliation of ideas than a lesson from the reconciliation of facts and we may expect anything from that mysterious power of progress which brought the orient and the occident face to face one fine day in the depths of a sepulchre and made the imaums converse with bonaparte in the interior of the great pyramid in the meantime let there be no halt no hesitation no pause in the grandiose onward march of minds social philosophy consists essentially in science and peace its object is and its result must be to dissolve wrath by the study of antagonisms it examines it scrutinizes it analyzes then it puts together once more it proceeds by means of reduction discarding all hatred more than once a society has been seen to give way before the wind which is let loose upon mankind history is full of the shipwrecks of nations and empires manners customs laws religions and some fine day that unknown force the hurricane passes by and bears them all away the civilizations of india of chaldea of persia of syria of egypt have disappeared one after the other why we know not what are the causes of these disasters we do not know could these societies have been saved was it their fault did they persist in the fatal vice which destroyed them what is the amount of suicide in these terrible deaths of a nation and a race questions to which there exists no reply darkness enwraps condemned civilizations they sprung a leak then they sank we have nothing more to say and it is with a sort of terror that we look on at the bottom of that sea which is called the past behind those colossal waves at the shipwreck of those immense vessels babylon nineveh tarsus thebes rome beneath the fearful gusts which emerge from all the mouths of the shadows but shadows are there and light is here we are not acquainted with the maladies of these ancient civilizations we do not know the infirmities of our own everywhere upon it we have the right of light we contemplate its beauties we lay bare its defects where it is ill we probe and the sickness once diagnosed the study of the cause leads to the discovery of the remedy our civilization the work of twenty centuries is its law and its prodigy it is worth the trouble of saving it will be saved it is already much to have solaced it its enlightenment is yet another point all the labors of modern social philosophies must converge towards this point the thinker of to day has a great duty to auscultate civilization we repeat that this auscultation brings encouragement it is by this persistence in encouragement that we wish to conclude these pages an austere interlude in a mournful drama beneath the social mortality we feel human imperishableness the globe does not perish because it has these wounds craters eruptions sulphur pits here and there nor because of a volcano which ejects its pus the maladies of the people do not kill man and yet any one who follows the course of social clinics shakes his head at times the strongest the tenderest the most logical have their hours of weakness will the future arrive it seems as though we might almost put this question when we behold so much terrible darkness melancholy face to face encounter of selfish and wretched on the part of the selfish the prejudices shadows of costly education appetite increasing through intoxication a giddiness of prosperity which dulls a fear of suffering which in some goes as far as an aversion for the suffering an implacable satisfaction the i so swollen that it bars the soul on the side of the wretched covetousness envy hatred of seeing others enjoy the profound impulses of the human beast towards assuaging its desires hearts full of mist sadness need fatality impure and simple ignorance shall we continue to raise our eyes to heaven is the luminous point which we distinguish there one of those which vanish the ideal is frightful to behold thus lost in the depths small isolated imperceptible brilliant but surrounded by those great black menaces monstrously heaped around it yet no more in danger than a star in the maw of the clouds book eighth enchantments and desolations chapter i full light the reader has probably understood that éponine having recognized through the gate the inhabitant of that rue plumet whither magnon had sent her had begun by keeping the ruffians away from the rue plumet and had then conducted marius thither and that after many days spent in ecstasy before that gate marius drawn on by that force which draws the iron to the magnet and a lover towards the stones of which is built the house of her whom he loves had finally entered cosette s garden as romeo entered the garden of juliet this had even proved easier for him than for romeo romeo was obliged to scale a wall marius had only to use a little force on one of the bars of the decrepit gate which vacillated in its rusty recess after the fashion of old people s teeth marius was slender and readily passed through as there was never any one in the street and as marius never entered the garden except at night he ran no risk of being seen beginning with that blessed and holy hour when a kiss betrothed these two souls marius was there every evening if at that period of her existence cosette had fallen in love with a man in the least unscrupulous or debauched she would have been lost for there are generous natures which yield themselves and cosette was one of them one of woman s magnanimities is to yield love at the height where it is absolute is complicated with some indescribably celestial blindness of modesty but what dangers you run o noble souls often you give the heart and we take the body your heart remains with you you gaze upon it in the gloom with a shudder love has no middle course it either ruins or it saves all human destiny lies in this dilemma this dilemma ruin or safety is set forth no more inexorably by any fatality than by love love is life if it is not death cradle also coffin the same sentiment says yes and no in the human heart of all the things that god has made the human heart is the one which sheds the most light alas and the most darkness god willed that cosette s love should encounter one of the loves which save throughout the whole of the month of may of that year 1832 there were there in every night in that poor neglected garden beneath that thicket which grew thicker and more fragrant day by day two beings composed of all chastity all innocence overflowing with all the felicity of heaven nearer to the archangels than to mankind pure honest intoxicated radiant who shone for each other amid the shadows it seemed to cosette that marius had a crown and to marius that cosette had a nimbus they touched each other they gazed at each other they clasped each other s hands they pressed close to each other but there was a distance which they did not pass not that they respected it they did not know of its existence marius was conscious of a barrier cosette s innocence and cosette of a support marius loyalty the first kiss had also been the last marius since that time had not gone further than to touch cosette s hand or her kerchief or a lock of her hair with his lips for him cosette was a perfume and not a woman he inhaled her she refused nothing and he asked nothing cosette was happy and marius was satisfied they lived in this ecstatic state which can be described as the dazzling of one soul by another soul it was the ineffable first embrace of two maiden souls in the ideal two swans meeting on the jungfrau at that hour of love an hour when voluptuousness is absolutely mute beneath the omnipotence of ecstasy marius the pure and seraphic marius would rather have gone to a woman of the town than have raised cosette s robe to the height of her ankle once in the moonlight cosette stooped to pick up something on the ground her bodice fell apart and permitted a glimpse of the beginning of her throat marius turned away his eyes what took place between these two beings nothing they adored each other at night when they were there that garden seemed a living and a sacred spot all flowers unfolded around them and sent them incense and they opened their souls and scattered them over the flowers the wanton and vigorous vegetation quivered full of strength and intoxication around these two innocents and they uttered words of love which set the trees to trembling what words were these breaths nothing more these breaths sufficed to trouble and to touch all nature round about magic power which we should find it difficult to understand were we to read in a book these conversations which are made to be borne away and dispersed like smoke wreaths by the breeze beneath the leaves take from those murmurs of two lovers that melody which proceeds from the soul and which accompanies them like a lyre and what remains is nothing more than a shade you say what is that all eh yes childish prattle repetitions laughter at nothing nonsense everything that is deepest and most sublime in the world the only things which are worth the trouble of saying and hearing the man who has never heard the man who has never uttered these absurdities these paltry remarks is an imbecile and a malicious fellow cosette said to marius dost thou know in all this and athwart this celestial maidenliness and without either of them being able to say how it had come about they had begun to call each other thou dost thou know my name is euphrasie euphrasie why no thy name is cosette oh cosette is a very ugly name that was given to me when i was a little thing but my real name is euphrasie dost thou like that name euphrasie yes but cosette is not ugly do you like it better than euphrasie why yes then i like it better too truly it is pretty cosette call me cosette and the smile that she added made of this dialogue an idyl worthy of a grove situated in heaven on another occasion she gazed intently at him and exclaimed monsieur you are handsome you are good looking you are witty you are not at all stupid you are much more learned than i am but i bid you defiance with this word i love you and marius in the very heavens thought he heard a strain sung by a star or she bestowed on him a gentle tap because he coughed and she said to him don t cough sir i will not have people cough on my domain without my permission it s very naughty to cough and to disturb me i want you to be well because in the first place if you were not well i should be very unhappy what should i do then and this was simply divine once marius said to cosette just imagine i thought at one time that your name was ursule this made both of them laugh the whole evening in the middle of another conversation he chanced to exclaim oh one day at the luxembourg i had a good mind to finish breaking up a veteran but he stopped short and went no further he would have been obliged to speak to cosette of her garter and that was impossible this bordered on a strange theme the flesh before which that immense and innocent love recoiled with a sort of sacred fright marius pictured life with cosette to himself like this without anything else to come every evening to the rue plumet to displace the old and accommodating bar of the chief justice s gate to sit elbow to elbow on that bench to gaze through the trees at the scintillation of the on coming night to fit a fold of the knee of his trousers into the ample fall of cosette s gown to caress her thumb nail to call her thou to smell of the same flower one after the other forever indefinitely during this time clouds passed above their heads every time that the wind blows it bears with it more of the dreams of men than of the clouds of heaven this chaste almost shy love was not devoid of gallantry by any means to pay compliments to the woman whom a man loves is the first method of bestowing caresses and he is half audacious who tries it a compliment is something like a kiss through a veil voluptuousness mingles there with its sweet tiny point while it hides itself the heart draws back before voluptuousness only to love the more marius blandishments all saturated with fancy were so to speak of azure hue the birds when they fly up yonder in the direction of the angels must hear such words there were mingled with them nevertheless life humanity all the positiveness of which marius was capable it was what is said in the bower a prelude to what will be said in the chamber a lyrical effusion strophe and sonnet intermingled pleasing hyperboles of cooing all the refinements of adoration arranged in a bouquet and exhaling a celestial perfume an ineffable twitter of heart to heart oh murmured marius how beautiful you are i dare not look at you it is all over with me when i contemplate you you are a grace i know not what is the matter with me the hem of your gown when the tip of your shoe peeps from beneath upsets me and then what an enchanted gleam when you open your thought even but a little you talk astonishingly good sense it seems to me at times that you are a dream speak i listen i admire oh cosette how strange it is and how charming i am really beside myself you are adorable mademoiselle i study your feet with the microscope and your soul with the telescope and cosette answered i have been loving a little more all the time that has passed since this morning questions and replies took care of themselves in this dialogue which always turned with mutual consent upon love as the little pith figures always turn on their peg cosette s whole person was ingenuousness ingenuity transparency whiteness candor radiance it might have been said of cosette that she was clear she produced on those who saw her the sensation of april and dawn there was dew in her eyes cosette was a condensation of the auroral light in the form of a woman it was quite simple that marius should admire her since he adored her but the truth is that this little school girl fresh from the convent talked with exquisite penetration and uttered at times all sorts of true and delicate sayings her prattle was conversation she never made a mistake about anything and she saw things justly the woman feels and speaks with the tender instinct of the heart which is infallible no one understands so well as a woman how to say things that are at once both sweet and deep sweetness and depth they are the whole of woman in them lies the whole of heaven in this full felicity tears welled up to their eyes every instant a crushed lady bug a feather fallen from a nest a branch of hawthorn broken aroused their pity and their ecstasy sweetly mingled with melancholy seemed to ask nothing better than to weep the most sovereign symptom of love is a tenderness that is at times almost unbearable and in addition to this all these contradictions are the lightning play of love they were fond of laughing they laughed readily and with a delicious freedom and so familiarly that they sometimes presented the air of two boys still though unknown to hearts intoxicated with purity nature is always present and will not be forgotten she is there with her brutal and sublime object and however great may be the innocence of souls one feels in the most modest private interview the adorable and mysterious shade which separates a couple of lovers from a pair of friends they idolized each other the permanent and the immutable are persistent people live they smile they laugh they make little grimaces with the tips of their lips they interlace their fingers they call each other thou and that does not prevent eternity two lovers hide themselves in the evening in the twilight in the invisible with the birds with the roses they fascinate each other in the darkness with their hearts which they throw into their eyes they murmur they whisper and in the meantime immense librations of the planets fill the infinite universe chapter ii the bewilderment of perfect happiness they existed vaguely frightened at their happiness they did not notice the cholera which decimated paris precisely during that very month they had confided in each other as far as possible but this had not extended much further than their names marius had told cosette that he was an orphan that his name was marius pontmercy that he was a lawyer that he lived by writing things for publishers that his father had been a colonel that the latter had been a hero and that he marius was on bad terms with his grandfather who was rich he had also hinted at being a baron but this had produced no effect on cosette she did not know the meaning of the word marius was marius on her side she had confided to him that she had been brought up at the petit picpus convent that her mother like his own was dead that her father s name was m fauchelevent that he was very good that he gave a great deal to the poor but that he was poor himself and that he denied himself everything though he denied her nothing strange to say in the sort of symphony which marius had lived since he had been in the habit of seeing cosette the past even the most recent past had become so confused and distant to him that what cosette told him satisfied him completely it did not even occur to him to tell her about the nocturnal adventure in the hovel about thénardier about the burn and about the strange attitude and singular flight of her father marius had momentarily forgotten all this in the evening he did not even know that there had been a morning what he had done where he had breakfasted nor who had spoken to him he had songs in his ears which rendered him deaf to every other thought he only existed at the hours when he saw cosette then as he was in heaven it was quite natural that he should forget earth both bore languidly the indefinable burden of immaterial pleasures thus lived these somnambulists who are called lovers alas who is there who has not felt all these things why does there come an hour when one emerges from this azure and why does life go on afterwards loving almost takes the place of thinking love is an ardent forgetfulness of all the rest then ask logic of passion if you will there is no more absolute logical sequence in the human heart than there is a perfect geometrical figure in the celestial mechanism for cosette and marius nothing existed except marius and cosette the universe around them had fallen into a hole they lived in a golden minute there was nothing before them nothing behind it hardly occurred to marius that cosette had a father his brain was dazzled and obliterated of what did these lovers talk then we have seen of the flowers and the swallows the setting sun and the rising moon and all sorts of important things they had told each other everything except everything the everything of lovers is nothing but the father the realities that lair the ruffians that adventure to what purpose and was he very sure that this nightmare had actually existed they were two and they adored each other and beyond that there was nothing nothing else existed it is probable that this vanishing of hell in our rear is inherent to the arrival of paradise have we beheld demons are there any have we trembled have we suffered we no longer know a rosy cloud hangs over it so these two beings lived in this manner high aloft with all that improbability which is in nature neither at the nadir nor at the zenith between man and seraphim above the mire below the ether in the clouds hardly flesh and blood soul and ecstasy from head to foot already too sublime to walk the earth still too heavily charged with humanity to disappear in the blue suspended like atoms which are waiting to be precipitated apparently beyond the bounds of destiny ignorant of that rut yesterday to day to morrow amazed rapturous floating soaring at times so light that they could take their flight out into the infinite almost prepared to soar away to all eternity they slept wide awake thus sweetly lulled oh splendid lethargy of the real overwhelmed by the ideal sometimes beautiful as cosette was marius shut his eyes in her presence the best way to look at the soul is through closed eyes marius and cosette never asked themselves whither this was to lead them they considered that they had already arrived it is a strange claim on man s part to wish that love should lead to something chapter iii the beginning of shadow jean valjean suspected nothing cosette who was rather less dreamy than marius was gay and that sufficed for jean valjean s happiness the thoughts which cosette cherished her tender preoccupations marius image which filled her heart took away nothing from the incomparable purity of her beautiful chaste and smiling brow she was at the age when the virgin bears her love as the angel his lily so jean valjean was at ease and then when two lovers have come to an understanding things always go well the third party who might disturb their love is kept in a state of perfect blindness by a restricted number of precautions which are always the same in the case of all lovers thus cosette never objected to any of jean valjean s proposals did she want to take a walk yes dear little father did she want to stay at home very good did he wish to pass the evening with cosette she was delighted as he always went to bed at ten o clock marius did not come to the garden on such occasions until after that hour when from the street he heard cosette open the long glass door on the veranda of course no one ever met marius in the daytime jean valjean never even dreamed any longer that marius was in existence only once one morning he chanced to say to cosette why you have whitewash on your back on the previous evening marius in a transport had pushed cosette against the wall old toussaint who retired early thought of nothing but her sleep and was as ignorant of the whole matter as jean valjean marius never set foot in the house when he was with cosette they hid themselves in a recess near the steps in order that they might neither be seen nor heard from the street and there they sat frequently contenting themselves by way of conversation with pressing each other s hands twenty times a minute as they gazed at the branches of the trees at such times a thunderbolt might have fallen thirty paces from them and they would not have noticed it so deeply was the revery of the one absorbed and sunk in the revery of the other limpid purity hours wholly white almost all alike this sort of love is a recollection of lily petals and the plumage of the dove the whole extent of the garden lay between them and the street every time that marius entered and left he carefully adjusted the bar of the gate in such a manner that no displacement was visible he usually went away about midnight and returned to courfeyrac s lodgings courfeyrac said to bahorel would you believe it marius comes home nowadays at one o clock in the morning bahorel replied what do you expect there s always a petard in a seminary fellow at times courfeyrac folded his arms assumed a serious air and said to marius you are getting irregular in your habits young man courfeyrac being a practical man did not take in good part this reflection of an invisible paradise upon marius he was not much in the habit of concealed passions it made him impatient and now and then he called upon marius to come back to reality one morning he threw him this admonition my dear fellow you produce upon me the effect of being located in the moon the realm of dreams the province of illusions capital soap bubble come be a good boy what s her name but nothing could induce marius to talk they might have torn out his nails before one of the two sacred syllables of which that ineffable name cosette was composed true love is as luminous as the dawn and as silent as the tomb only courfeyrac saw this change in marius that his taciturnity was of the beaming order during this sweet month of may marius and cosette learned to know these immense delights to dispute and to say you for thou simply that they might say thou the better afterwards to talk at great length with very minute details of persons in whom they took not the slightest interest in the world another proof that in that ravishing opera called love the libretto counts for almost nothing for marius to listen to cosette discussing finery for cosette to listen to marius talk in politics to listen knee pressed to knee to the carriages rolling along the rue de babylone to gaze upon the same planet in space or at the same glowworm gleaming in the grass to hold their peace together a still greater delight than conversation etc etc in the meantime divers complications were approaching one evening marius was on his way to the rendezvous by way of the boulevard des invalides he habitually walked with drooping head as he was on the point of turning the corner of the rue plumet he heard some one quite close to him say good evening monsieur marius he raised his head and recognized éponine this produced a singular effect upon him he had not thought of that girl a single time since the day when she had conducted him to the rue plumet he had not seen her again and she had gone completely out of his mind he had no reasons for anything but gratitude towards her he owed her his happiness and yet it was embarrassing to him to meet her it is an error to think that passion when it is pure and happy leads man to a state of perfection it simply leads him as we have noted to a state of oblivion in this situation man forgets to be bad but he also forgets to be good gratitude duty matters essential and important to be remembered vanish at any other time marius would have behaved quite differently to éponine absorbed in cosette he had not even clearly put it to himself that this éponine was named éponine thénardier and that she bore the name inscribed in his father s will that name for which but a few months before he would have so ardently sacrificed himself we show marius as he was his father himself was fading out of his soul to some extent under the splendor of his love he replied with some embarrassment ah so it s you éponine why do you call me you have i done anything to you no he answered certainly he had nothing against her far from it only he felt that he could not do otherwise now that he used thou to cosette than say you to éponine as he remained silent she exclaimed say then she paused it seemed as though words failed that creature formerly so heedless and so bold she tried to smile and could not then she resumed well then she paused again and remained with downcast eyes good evening mr marius said she suddenly and abruptly and away she went chapter iv a cab runs in english and barks in slang the following day was the 3d of june 1832 a date which it is necessary to indicate on account of the grave events which at that epoch hung on the horizon of paris in the state of lightning charged clouds marius at nightfall was pursuing the same road as on the preceding evening with the same thoughts of delight in his heart when he caught sight of éponine approaching through the trees of the boulevard two days in succession this was too much he turned hastily aside quitted the boulevard changed his course and went to the rue plumet through the rue monsieur this caused éponine to follow him to the rue plumet a thing which she had not yet done up to that time she had contented herself with watching him on his passage along the boulevard without ever seeking to encounter him it was only on the evening before that she had attempted to address him so éponine followed him without his suspecting the fact she saw him displace the bar and slip into the garden she approached the railing felt of the bars one after the other and readily recognized the one which marius had moved she murmured in a low voice and in gloomy accents none of that lisette she seated herself on the underpinning of the railing close beside the bar as though she were guarding it it was precisely at the point where the railing touched the neighboring wall there was a dim nook there in which éponine was entirely concealed she remained thus for more than an hour without stirring and without breathing a prey to her thoughts towards ten o clock in the evening one of the two or three persons who passed through the rue plumet an old belated bourgeois who was making haste to escape from this deserted spot of evil repute as he skirted the garden railings and reached the angle which it made with the wall heard a dull and threatening voice saying i m no longer surprised that he comes here every evening the passer by cast a glance around him saw no one dared not peer into the black niche and was greatly alarmed he redoubled his pace this passer by had reason to make haste for a very few instants later six men who were marching separately and at some distance from each other along the wall and who might have been taken for a gray patrol entered the rue plumet the first to arrive at the garden railing halted and waited for the others a second later all six were reunited these men began to talk in a low voice this is the place said one of them is there a cab dog in the garden asked another i don t know in any case i have fetched a ball that we ll make him eat have you some putty to break the pane with yes the railing is old interpolated a fifth who had the voice of a ventriloquist so much the better said the second who had spoken it won t screech under the saw and it won t be hard to cut the sixth who had not yet opened his lips now began to inspect the gate as éponine had done an hour earlier grasping each bar in succession and shaking them cautiously thus he came to the bar which marius had loosened as he was on the point of grasping this bar a hand emerged abruptly from the darkness fell upon his arm he felt himself vigorously thrust aside by a push in the middle of his breast and a hoarse voice said to him but not loudly there s a dog at the same moment he perceived a pale girl standing before him the man underwent that shock which the unexpected always brings he bristled up in hideous wise nothing is so formidable to behold as ferocious beasts who are uneasy their terrified air evokes terror he recoiled and stammered what jade is this your daughter it was in fact éponine who had addressed thénardier at the apparition of éponine the other five that is to say claquesous guelemer babet brujon and montparnasse had noiselessly drawn near without precipitation without uttering a word with the sinister slowness peculiar to these men of the night some indescribable but hideous tools were visible in their hands guelemer held one of those pairs of curved pincers which prowlers call fanchons ah see here what are you about there what do you want with us are you crazy exclaimed thénardier as loudly as one can exclaim and still speak low what have you come here to hinder our work for éponine burst out laughing and threw herself on his neck i am here little father because i am here isn t a person allowed to sit on the stones nowadays it s you who ought not to be here what have you come here for since it s a biscuit i told magnon so there s nothing to be done here but embrace me my good little father it s a long time since i ve seen you so you re out thénardier tried to disentangle himself from éponine s arms and grumbled that s good you ve embraced me yes i m out i m not in now get away with you but éponine did not release her hold and redoubled her caresses but how did you manage it little pa you must have been very clever to get out of that tell me about it and my mother where is mother tell me about mamma thénardier replied she s well i don t know let me alone and be off i tell you i won t go so there now pouted éponine like a spoiled child you send me off and it s four months since i saw you and i ve hardly had time to kiss you and she caught her father round the neck again come now this is stupid said babet make haste said guelemer the cops may pass the ventriloquist s voice repeated his distich nous n sommes pas le jour de l an this isn t new year s day a bécoter papa maman to peck at pa and ma éponine turned to the five ruffians why it s monsieur brujon good day monsieur babet good day monsieur claquesous don t you know me monsieur guelemer how goes it montparnasse yes they know you ejaculated thénardier but good day good evening sheer off leave us alone it s the hour for foxes not for chickens said montparnasse you see the job we have on hand here added babet éponine caught montparnasse s hand take care said he you ll cut yourself i ve a knife open my little montparnasse responded éponine very gently you must have confidence in people i am the daughter of my father perhaps monsieur babet monsieur guelemer i m the person who was charged to investigate this matter it is remarkable that éponine did not talk slang that frightful tongue had become impossible to her since she had known marius she pressed in her hand small bony and feeble as that of a skeleton guelemer s huge coarse fingers and continued you know well that i m no fool ordinarily i am believed i have rendered you service on various occasions well i have made inquiries you will expose yourselves to no purpose you see i swear to you that there is nothing in this house there are lone women said guelemer no the persons have moved away the candles haven t anyway ejaculated babet and he pointed out to éponine across the tops of the trees a light which was wandering about in the mansard roof of the pavilion it was toussaint who had stayed up to spread out some linen to dry éponine made a final effort well said she they re very poor folks and it s a hovel where there isn t a sou go to the devil cried thénardier when we ve turned the house upside down and put the cellar at the top and the attic below we ll tell you what there is inside and whether it s francs or sous or half farthings and he pushed her aside with the intention of entering my good friend mr montparnasse said éponine i entreat you you are a good fellow don t enter take care you ll cut yourself replied montparnasse thénardier resumed in his decided tone decamp my girl and leave men to their own affairs éponine released montparnasse s hand which she had grasped again and said so you mean to enter this house rather grinned the ventriloquist then she set her back against the gate faced the six ruffians who were armed to the teeth and to whom the night lent the visages of demons and said in a firm low voice well i don t mean that you shall they halted in amazement the ventriloquist however finished his grin she went on friends listen well this is not what you want now i m talking in the first place if you enter this garden if you lay a hand on this gate i ll scream i ll beat on the door i ll rouse everybody i ll have the whole six of you seized i ll call the police she d do it too said thénardier in a low tone to brujon and the ventriloquist she shook her head and added beginning with my father thénardier stepped nearer not so close my good man said she he retreated growling between his teeth why what s the matter with her and he added bitch she began to laugh in a terrible way as you like but you shall not enter here i m not the daughter of a dog since i m the daughter of a wolf there are six of you what matters that to me you are men well i m a woman you don t frighten me i tell you that you shan t enter this house because it doesn t suit me if you approach i ll bark i told you i m the dog and i don t care a straw for you go your way you bore me go where you please but don t come here i forbid it you can use your knives i ll use kicks it s all the same to me come on she advanced a pace nearer the ruffians she was terrible she burst out laughing pardine i m not afraid i shall be hungry this summer and i shall be cold this winter aren t they ridiculous these ninnies of men to think they can scare a girl what scare oh yes much because you have finical poppets of mistresses who hide under the bed when you put on a big voice forsooth i ain t afraid of anything that i ain t she fastened her intent gaze upon thénardier and said not even of you father then she continued as she cast her blood shot spectre like eyes upon the ruffians in turn what do i care if i m picked up to morrow morning on the pavement of the rue plumet killed by the blows of my father s club or whether i m found a year from now in the nets at saint cloud or the isle of swans in the midst of rotten old corks and drowned dogs she was forced to pause she was seized by a dry cough her breath came from her weak and narrow chest like the death rattle she resumed i have only to cry out and people will come and then slap bang there are six of you i represent the whole world thénardier made a movement towards her don t approach she cried he halted and said gently well no i won t approach but don t speak so loud so you intend to hinder us in our work my daughter but we must earn our living all the same have you no longer any kind feeling for your father you bother me said éponine but we must live we must eat burst so saying she seated herself on the underpinning of the fence and hummed mon bras si dodu my arm so plump ma jambe bien faite my leg well formed et le temps perdu and time wasted she had set her elbow on her knee and her chin in her hand and she swung her foot with an air of indifference her tattered gown permitted a view of her thin shoulder blades the neighboring street lantern illuminated her profile and her attitude nothing more resolute and more surprising could be seen the six rascals speechless and gloomy at being held in check by a girl retreated beneath the shadow cast by the lantern and held counsel with furious and humiliated shrugs in the meantime she stared at them with a stern but peaceful air there s something the matter with her said babet a reason is she in love with the dog it s a shame to miss this anyway two women an old fellow who lodges in the back yard and curtains that ain t so bad at the windows the old cove must be a jew i think the job s a good one well go in then the rest of you exclaimed montparnasse do the job i ll stay here with the girl and if she fails us he flashed the knife which he held open in his hand in the light of the lantern thénardier said not a word and seemed ready for whatever the rest pleased brujon who was somewhat of an oracle and who had as the reader knows put up the job had not as yet spoken he seemed thoughtful he had the reputation of not sticking at anything and it was known that he had plundered a police post simply out of bravado besides this he made verses and songs which gave him great authority babet interrogated him you say nothing brujon brujon remained silent an instant longer then he shook his head in various ways and finally concluded to speak see here this morning i came across two sparrows fighting this evening i jostled a woman who was quarrelling all that s bad let s quit they went away as they went montparnasse muttered never mind if they had wanted i d have cut her throat babet responded i wouldn t i don t hit a lady at the corner of the street they halted and exchanged the following enigmatical dialogue in a low tone where shall we go to sleep to night under pantin paris have you the key to the gate thénardier pardi éponine who never took her eyes off of them saw them retreat by the road by which they had come she rose and began to creep after them along the walls and the houses she followed them thus as far as the boulevard there they parted and she saw these six men plunge into the gloom where they appeared to melt away chapter v things of the night after the departure of the ruffians the rue plumet resumed its tranquil nocturnal aspect that which had just taken place in this street would not have astonished a forest the lofty trees the copses the heaths the branches rudely interlaced the tall grass exist in a sombre manner the savage swarming there catches glimpses of sudden apparitions of the invisible that which is below man distinguishes through the mists that which is beyond man and the things of which we living beings are ignorant there meet face to face in the night nature bristling and wild takes alarm at certain approaches in which she fancies that she feels the supernatural the forces of the gloom know each other and are strangely balanced by each other teeth and claws fear what they cannot grasp blood drinking bestiality voracious appetites hunger in search of prey the armed instincts of nails and jaws which have for source and aim the belly glare and smell out uneasily the impassive spectral forms straying beneath a shroud erect in its vague and shuddering robe and which seem to them to live with a dead and terrible life these brutalities which are only matter entertain a confused fear of having to deal with the immense obscurity condensed into an unknown being a black figure barring the way stops the wild beast short that which emerges from the cemetery intimidates and disconcerts that which emerges from the cave the ferocious fear the sinister wolves recoil when they encounter a ghoul chapter vi marius becomes practical once more to the extent of giving cosette his address while this sort of a dog with a human face was mounting guard over the gate and while the six ruffians were yielding to a girl marius was by cosette s side never had the sky been more studded with stars and more charming the trees more trembling the odor of the grass more penetrating never had the birds fallen asleep among the leaves with a sweeter noise never had all the harmonies of universal serenity responded more thoroughly to the inward music of love never had marius been more captivated more happy more ecstatic but he had found cosette sad cosette had been weeping her eyes were red this was the first cloud in that wonderful dream marius first word had been what is the matter and she had replied this then she had seated herself on the bench near the steps and while he tremblingly took his place beside her she had continued my father told me this morning to hold myself in readiness because he has business and we may go away from here marius shivered from head to foot when one is at the end of one s life to die means to go away when one is at the beginning of it to go away means to die for the last six weeks marius had little by little slowly by degrees taken possession of cosette each day as we have already explained in the case of first love the soul is taken long before the body later on one takes the body long before the soul sometimes one does not take the soul at all the faublas and the prudhommes add because there is none but the sarcasm is fortunately a blasphemy so marius possessed cosette as spirits possess but he enveloped her with all his soul and seized her jealously with incredible conviction he possessed her smile her breath her perfume the profound radiance of her blue eyes the sweetness of her skin when he touched her hand the charming mark which she had on her neck all her thoughts therefore he possessed all cosette s dreams he incessantly gazed at and he sometimes touched lightly with his breath the short locks on the nape of her neck and he declared to himself that there was not one of those short hairs which did not belong to him marius he gazed upon and adored the things that she wore her knot of ribbon her gloves her sleeves her shoes her cuffs as sacred objects of which he was the master he dreamed that he was the lord of those pretty shell combs which she wore in her hair and he even said to himself in confused and suppressed stammerings of voluptuousness which did not make their way to the light that there was not a ribbon of her gown not a mesh in her stockings not a fold in her bodice which was not his beside cosette he felt himself beside his own property his own thing his own despot and his slave it seemed as though they had so intermingled their souls that it would have been impossible to tell them apart had they wished to take them back again this is mine no it is mine i assure you that you are mistaken this is my property what you are taking as your own is myself marius was something that made a part of cosette and cosette was something which made a part of marius marius felt cosette within him to have cosette to possess cosette this to him was not to be distinguished from breathing it was in the midst of this faith of this intoxication of this virgin possession unprecedented and absolute of this sovereignty that these words we are going away fell suddenly at a blow and that the harsh voice of reality cried to him cosette is not yours marius awoke for six weeks marius had been living as we have said outside of life those words going away caused him to re enter it harshly he found not a word to say cosette merely felt that his hand was very cold she said to him in her turn what is the matter he replied in so low a tone that cosette hardly heard him i did not understand what you said she began again this morning my father told me to settle all my little affairs and to hold myself in readiness that he would give me his linen to put in a trunk that he was obliged to go on a journey that we were to go away that it is necessary to have a large trunk for me and a small one for him and that all is to be ready in a week from now and that we might go to england but this is outrageous exclaimed marius it is certain that at that moment no abuse of power no violence not one of the abominations of the worst tyrants no action of busiris of tiberius or of henry viii could have equalled this in atrocity in the opinion of marius m fauchelevent taking his daughter off to england because he had business there he demanded in a weak voice and when do you start he did not say when and when shall you return he did not say when marius rose and said coldly cosette shall you go cosette turned toward him her beautiful eyes all filled with anguish and replied in a sort of bewilderment where to england shall you go why do you say you to me i ask you whether you will go what do you expect me to do she said clasping her hands so you will go if my father goes so you will go cosette took marius hand and pressed it without replying very well said marius then i will go elsewhere cosette felt rather than understood the meaning of these words she turned so pale that her face shone white through the gloom she stammered what do you mean marius looked at her then raised his eyes to heaven and answered nothing when his eyes fell again he saw cosette smiling at him the smile of a woman whom one loves possesses a visible radiance even at night how silly we are marius i have an idea what is it if we go away do you go too i will tell you where come and join me wherever i am marius was now a thoroughly roused man he had fallen back into reality he cried to cosette go away with you are you mad why i should have to have money and i have none go to england but i am in debt now i owe i don t know how much more than ten louis to courfeyrac one of my friends with whom you are not acquainted i have an old hat which is not worth three francs i have a coat which lacks buttons in front my shirt is all ragged my elbows are torn my boots let in the water for the last six weeks i have not thought about it and i have not told you about it you only see me at night and you give me your love if you were to see me in the daytime you would give me a sou go to england eh i haven t enough to pay for a passport he threw himself against a tree which was close at hand erect his brow pressed close to the bark feeling neither the wood which flayed his skin nor the fever which was throbbing in his temples and there he stood motionless on the point of falling like the statue of despair he remained a long time thus one could remain for eternity in such abysses at last he turned round he heard behind him a faint stifled noise which was sweet yet sad it was cosette sobbing she had been weeping for more than two hours beside marius as he meditated he came to her fell at her knees and slowly prostrating himself he took the tip of her foot which peeped out from beneath her robe and kissed it she let him have his way in silence there are moments when a woman accepts like a sombre and resigned goddess the religion of love do not weep he said she murmured not when i may be going away and you cannot come he went on do you love me she replied sobbing by that word from paradise which is never more charming than amid tears i adore you he continued in a tone which was an indescribable caress do not weep tell me will you do this for me and cease to weep do you love me said she he took her hand cosette i have never given my word of honor to any one because my word of honor terrifies me i feel that my father is by my side well i give you my most sacred word of honor that if you go away i shall die in the tone with which he uttered these words there lay a melancholy so solemn and so tranquil that cosette trembled she felt that chill which is produced by a true and gloomy thing as it passes by the shock made her cease weeping now listen said he do not expect me to morrow why do not expect me until the day after to morrow oh why you will see a day without seeing you but that is impossible let us sacrifice one day in order to gain our whole lives perhaps and marius added in a low tone and in an aside he is a man who never changes his habits and he has never received any one except in the evening of what man are you speaking asked cosette i i said nothing what do you hope then wait until the day after to morrow you wish it yes cosette she took his head in both her hands raising herself on tiptoe in order to be on a level with him and tried to read his hope in his eyes marius resumed now that i think of it you ought to know my address something might happen one never knows i live with that friend named courfeyrac rue de la verrerie no 16 he searched in his pocket pulled out his penknife and with the blade he wrote on the plaster of the wall 16 rue de la verrerie in the meantime cosette had begun to gaze into his eyes once more tell me your thought marius you have some idea tell it to me oh tell me so that i may pass a pleasant night this is my idea that it is impossible that god should mean to part us wait expect me the day after to morrow what shall i do until then said cosette you are outside you go and come how happy men are i shall remain entirely alone oh how sad i shall be what is it that you are going to do to morrow evening tell me i am going to try something then i will pray to god and i will think of you here so that you may be successful i will question you no further since you do not wish it you are my master i shall pass the evening to morrow in singing that music from euryanthe that you love and that you came one evening to listen to outside my shutters but day after to morrow you will come early i shall expect you at dusk at nine o clock precisely i warn you mon dieu how sad it is that the days are so long on the stroke of nine do you understand i shall be in the garden and i also and without having uttered it moved by the same thought impelled by those electric currents which place lovers in continual communication both being intoxicated with delight even in their sorrow they fell into each other s arms without perceiving that their lips met while their uplifted eyes overflowing with rapture and full of tears gazed upon the stars when marius went forth the street was deserted this was the moment when éponine was following the ruffians to the boulevard while marius had been dreaming with his head pressed to the tree an idea had crossed his mind an idea alas that he himself judged to be senseless and impossible he had come to a desperate decision chapter vii the old heart and the young heart in the presence of each other at that epoch father gillenormand was well past his ninety first birthday he still lived with mademoiselle gillenormand in the rue des filles du calvaire no 6 in the old house which he owned he was as the reader will remember one of those antique old men who await death perfectly erect whom age bears down without bending and whom even sorrow cannot curve still his daughter had been saying for some time my father is sinking he no longer boxed the maids ears he no longer thumped the landing place so vigorously with his cane when basque was slow in opening the door the revolution of july had exasperated him for the space of barely six months he had viewed almost tranquilly that coupling of words in the moniteur m humblot conté peer of france the fact is that the old man was deeply dejected he did not bend he did not yield this was no more a characteristic of his physical than of his moral nature but he felt himself giving way internally for four years he had been waiting for marius with his foot firmly planted that is the exact word in the conviction that that good for nothing young scamp would ring at his door some day or other now he had reached the point where at certain gloomy hours he said to himself that if marius made him wait much longer it was not death that was insupportable to him it was the idea that perhaps he should never see marius again the idea of never seeing marius again had never entered his brain until that day now the thought began to recur to him and it chilled him absence as is always the case in genuine and natural sentiments had only served to augment the grandfather s love for the ungrateful child who had gone off like a flash it is during december nights when the cold stands at ten degrees that one thinks oftenest of the son m gillenormand was or thought himself above all things incapable of taking a single step he the grandfather towards his grandson i would die rather he said to himself he did not consider himself as the least to blame but he thought of marius only with profound tenderness and the mute despair of an elderly kindly old man who is about to vanish in the dark he began to lose his teeth which added to his sadness m gillenormand without however acknowledging it to himself for it would have rendered him furious and ashamed had never loved a mistress as he loved marius he had had placed in his chamber opposite the head of his bed so that it should be the first thing on which his eyes fell on waking an old portrait of his other daughter who was dead madame pontmercy a portrait which had been taken when she was eighteen he gazed incessantly at that portrait one day he happened to say as he gazed upon it i think the likeness is strong to my sister inquired mademoiselle gillenormand yes certainly the old man added and to him also once as he sat with his knees pressed together and his eyes almost closed in a despondent attitude his daughter ventured to say to him father are you as angry with him as ever she paused not daring to proceed further with whom he demanded with that poor marius he raised his aged head laid his withered and emaciated fist on the table and exclaimed in his most irritated and vibrating tone poor marius do you say that gentleman is a knave a wretched scoundrel a vain little ingrate a heartless soulless haughty and wicked man and he turned away so that his daughter might not see the tear that stood in his eye three days later he broke a silence which had lasted four hours to say to his daughter point blank i had the honor to ask mademoiselle gillenormand never to mention him to me aunt gillenormand renounced every effort and pronounced this acute diagnosis my father never cared very much for my sister after her folly it is clear that he detests marius after her folly meant after she had married the colonel however as the reader has been able to conjecture mademoiselle gillenormand had failed in her attempt to substitute her favorite the officer of lancers for marius the substitute théodule had not been a success m gillenormand had not accepted the quid pro quo a vacancy in the heart does not accommodate itself to a stop gap théodule on his side though he scented the inheritance was disgusted at the task of pleasing the goodman bored the lancer and the lancer shocked the goodman lieutenant théodule was gay no doubt but a chatter box frivolous but vulgar a high liver but a frequenter of bad company he had mistresses it is true and he had a great deal to say about them it is true also but he talked badly all his good qualities had a defect m gillenormand was worn out with hearing him tell about the love affairs that he had in the vicinity of the barracks in the rue de babylone and then lieutenant gillenormand sometimes came in his uniform with the tricolored cockade this rendered him downright intolerable finally father gillenormand had said to his daughter i ve had enough of that théodule i haven t much taste for warriors in time of peace receive him if you choose i don t know but i prefer slashers to fellows that drag their swords the clash of blades in battle is less dismal after all than the clank of the scabbard on the pavement and then throwing out your chest like a bully and lacing yourself like a girl with stays under your cuirass is doubly ridiculous when one is a veritable man one holds equally aloof from swagger and from affected airs he is neither a blusterer nor a finnicky hearted man keep your théodule for yourself it was in vain that his daughter said to him but he is your grandnephew nevertheless it turned out that m gillenormand who was a grandfather to the very finger tips was not in the least a grand uncle in fact as he had good sense and as he had compared the two théodule had only served to make him regret marius all the more one evening it was the 24th of june which did not prevent father gillenormand having a rousing fire on the hearth he had dismissed his daughter who was sewing in a neighboring apartment he was alone in his chamber amid its pastoral scenes with his feet propped on the andirons half enveloped in his huge screen of coromandel lacquer with its nine leaves with his elbow resting on a table where burned two candles under a green shade engulfed in his tapestry armchair and in his hand a book which he was not reading he was dressed according to his wont like an incroyable and resembled an antique portrait by garat this would have made people run after him in the street had not his daughter covered him up whenever he went out in a vast bishop s wadded cloak which concealed his attire at home he never wore a dressing gown except when he rose and retired it gives one a look of age said he father gillenormand was thinking of marius lovingly and bitterly and as usual bitterness predominated his tenderness once soured always ended by boiling and turning to indignation he had reached the point where a man tries to make up his mind and to accept that which rends his heart he was explaining to himself that there was no longer any reason why marius should return that if he intended to return he should have done it long ago that he must renounce the idea he was trying to accustom himself to the thought that all was over and that he should die without having beheld that gentleman again but his whole nature revolted his aged paternity would not consent to this well said he this was his doleful refrain he will not return his bald head had fallen upon his breast and he fixed a melancholy and irritated gaze upon the ashes on his hearth in the very midst of his revery his old servant basque entered and inquired can monsieur receive m marius the old man sat up erect pallid and like a corpse which rises under the influence of a galvanic shock all his blood had retreated to his heart he stammered m marius what i don t know replied basque intimidated and put out of countenance by his master s air i have not seen him nicolette came in and said to me there s a young man here say that it is m marius father gillenormand stammered in a low voice show him in and he remained in the same attitude with shaking head and his eyes fixed on the door it opened once more a young man entered it was marius marius halted at the door as though waiting to be bidden to enter his almost squalid attire was not perceptible in the obscurity caused by the shade nothing could be seen but his calm grave but strangely sad face it was several minutes before father gillenormand dulled with amazement and joy could see anything except a brightness as when one is in the presence of an apparition he was on the point of swooning he saw marius through a dazzling light it certainly was he it certainly was marius at last after the lapse of four years he grasped him entire so to speak in a single glance he found him noble handsome distinguished well grown a complete man with a suitable mien and a charming air he felt a desire to open his arms to call him to fling himself forward his heart melted with rapture affectionate words swelled and overflowed his breast at length all his tenderness came to the light and reached his lips and by a contrast which constituted the very foundation of his nature what came forth was harshness he said abruptly what have you come here for marius replied with embarrassment monsieur m gillenormand would have liked to have marius throw himself into his arms he was displeased with marius and with himself he was conscious that he was brusque and that marius was cold it caused the goodman unendurable and irritating anxiety to feel so tender and forlorn within and only to be able to be hard outside bitterness returned he interrupted marius in a peevish tone then why did you come that then signified if you do not come to embrace me marius looked at his grandfather whose pallor gave him a face of marble monsieur have you come to beg my pardon do you acknowledge your faults he thought he was putting marius on the right road and that the child would yield marius shivered it was the denial of his father that was required of him he dropped his eyes and replied no sir then exclaimed the old man impetuously with a grief that was poignant and full of wrath what do you want of me marius clasped his hands advanced a step and said in a feeble and trembling voice sir have pity on me these words touched m gillenormand uttered a little sooner they would have rendered him tender but they came too late the grandfather rose he supported himself with both hands on his cane his lips were white his brow wavered but his lofty form towered above marius as he bowed pity on you sir it is youth demanding pity of the old man of ninety one you are entering into life i am leaving it you go to the play to balls to the café to the billiard hall you have wit you please the women you are a handsome fellow as for me i spit on my brands in the heart of summer you are rich with the only riches that are really such i possess all the poverty of age infirmity isolation you have your thirty two teeth a good digestion bright eyes strength appetite health gayety a forest of black hair i have no longer even white hair i have lost my teeth i am losing my legs i am losing my memory there are three names of streets that i confound incessantly the rue charlot the rue du chaume and the rue saint claude that is what i have come to you have before you the whole future full of sunshine and i am beginning to lose my sight so far am i advancing into the night you are in love that is a matter of course i am beloved by no one in all the world and you ask pity of me parbleu molière forgot that if that is the way you jest at the courthouse messieurs the lawyers i sincerely compliment you you are droll and the octogenarian went on in a grave and angry voice come now what do you want of me sir said marius i know that my presence is displeasing to you but i have come merely to ask one thing of you and then i shall go away immediately you are a fool said the old man who said that you were to go away this was the translation of the tender words which lay at the bottom of his heart ask my pardon throw yourself on my neck m gillenormand felt that marius would leave him in a few moments that his harsh reception had repelled the lad that his hardness was driving him away he said all this to himself and it augmented his grief and as his grief was straightway converted into wrath it increased his harshness he would have liked to have marius understand and marius did not understand which made the goodman furious he began again what you deserted me your grandfather you left my house to go no one knows whither you drove your aunt to despair you went off it is easily guessed to lead a bachelor life it s more convenient to play the dandy to come in at all hours to amuse yourself you have given me no signs of life you have contracted debts without even telling me to pay them you have become a smasher of windows and a blusterer and at the end of four years you come to me and that is all you have to say to me this violent fashion of driving a grandson to tenderness was productive only of silence on the part of marius m gillenormand folded his arms a gesture which with him was peculiarly imperious and apostrophized marius bitterly let us make an end of this you have come to ask something of me you say well what what is it speak sir said marius with the look of a man who feels that he is falling over a precipice i have come to ask your permission to marry m gillenormand rang the bell basque opened the door half way call my daughter a second later the door was opened once more mademoiselle gillenormand did not enter but showed herself marius was standing mute with pendant arms and the face of a criminal m gillenormand was pacing back and forth in the room he turned to his daughter and said to her nothing it is monsieur marius say good day to him monsieur wishes to marry that s all go away the curt hoarse sound of the old man s voice announced a strange degree of excitement the aunt gazed at marius with a frightened air hardly appeared to recognize him did not allow a gesture or a syllable to escape her and disappeared at her father s breath more swiftly than a straw before the hurricane in the meantime father gillenormand had returned and placed his back against the chimney piece once more you marry at one and twenty you have arranged that you have only a permission to ask a formality sit down sir well you have had a revolution since i had the honor to see you last the jacobins got the upper hand you must have been delighted are you not a republican since you are a baron you can make that agree the republic makes a good sauce for the barony are you one of those decorated by july have you taken the louvre at all sir quite near here in the rue saint antoine opposite the rue des nonamdières there is a cannon ball incrusted in the wall of the third story of a house with this inscription july 28th 1830 go take a look at that it produces a good effect ah those friends of yours do pretty things by the way aren t they erecting a fountain in the place of the monument of m le duc de berry so you want to marry whom can one inquire without indiscretion he paused and before marius had time to answer he added violently come now you have a profession a fortune made how much do you earn at your trade of lawyer nothing said marius with a sort of firmness and resolution that was almost fierce nothing then all that you have to live upon is the twelve hundred livres that i allow you marius did not reply m gillenormand continued then i understand the girl is rich as rich as i am what no dowry no expectations i think not utterly naked what s the father i don t know and what s her name mademoiselle fauchelevent fauchewhat fauchelevent pttt ejaculated the old gentleman sir exclaimed marius m gillenormand interrupted him with the tone of a man who is speaking to himself that s right one and twenty years of age no profession twelve hundred livres a year madame la baronne de pontmercy will go and purchase a couple of sous worth of parsley from the fruiterer sir repeated marius in the despair at the last hope which was vanishing i entreat you i conjure you in the name of heaven with clasped hands sir i throw myself at your feet permit me to marry her the old man burst into a shout of strident and mournful laughter coughing and laughing at the same time ah ah ah you said to yourself pardine i ll go hunt up that old blockhead that absurd numskull what a shame that i m not twenty five how i d treat him to a nice respectful summons how nicely i d get along without him it s nothing to me i d say to him you re only too happy to see me you old idiot i want to marry i desire to wed mamselle no matter whom daughter of monsieur no matter what i have no shoes she has no chemise that just suits i want to throw my career my future my youth my life to the dogs i wish to take a plunge into wretchedness with a woman around my neck that s an idea and you must consent to it and the old fossil will consent go my lad do as you like attach your paving stone marry your pousselevent your coupelevent never sir never father never at the tone in which that never was uttered marius lost all hope he traversed the chamber with slow steps with bowed head tottering and more like a dying man than like one merely taking his departure m gillenormand followed him with his eyes and at the moment when the door opened and marius was on the point of going out he advanced four paces with the senile vivacity of impetuous and spoiled old gentlemen seized marius by the collar brought him back energetically into the room flung him into an armchair and said to him tell me all about it it was that single word father which had effected this revolution marius stared at him in bewilderment m gillenormand s mobile face was no longer expressive of anything but rough and ineffable good nature the grandsire had given way before the grandfather come see here speak tell me about your love affairs jabber tell me everything sapristi how stupid young folks are father repeated marius the old man s entire countenance lighted up with indescribable radiance yes that s right call me father and you ll see there was now something so kind so gentle so openhearted and so paternal in this brusqueness that marius in the sudden transition from discouragement to hope was stunned and intoxicated by it as it were he was seated near the table the light from the candles brought out the dilapidation of his costume which father gillenormand regarded with amazement well father said marius ah by the way interrupted m gillenormand you really have not a penny then you are dressed like a pickpocket he rummaged in a drawer drew forth a purse which he laid on the table here are a hundred louis buy yourself a hat father pursued marius my good father if you only knew i love her you cannot imagine it the first time i saw her was at the luxembourg she came there in the beginning i did not pay much heed to her and then i don t know how it came about i fell in love with her oh how unhappy that made me now at last i see her every day at her own home her father does not know it just fancy they are going away it is in the garden that we meet in the evening her father means to take her to england then i said to myself i ll go and see my grandfather and tell him all about the affair i should go mad first i should die i should fall ill i should throw myself into the water i absolutely must marry her since i should go mad otherwise this is the whole truth and i do not think that i have omitted anything she lives in a garden with an iron fence in the rue plumet it is in the neighborhood of the invalides father gillenormand had seated himself with a beaming countenance beside marius as he listened to him and drank in the sound of his voice he enjoyed at the same time a protracted pinch of snuff at the words rue plumet he interrupted his inhalation and allowed the remainder of his snuff to fall upon his knees the rue plumet the rue plumet did you say let us see are there not barracks in that vicinity why yes that s it your cousin théodule has spoken to me about it the lancer the officer a gay girl my good friend a gay girl pardieu yes the rue plumet it is what used to be called the rue blomet it all comes back to me now i have heard of that little girl of the iron railing in the rue plumet in a garden a pamela your taste is not bad she is said to be a very tidy creature between ourselves i think that simpleton of a lancer has been courting her a bit i don t know where he did it however that s not to the purpose besides he is not to be believed he brags marius i think it quite proper that a young man like you should be in love it s the right thing at your age i like you better as a lover than as a jacobin i like you better in love with a petticoat sapristi with twenty petticoats than with m de robespierre for my part i will do myself the justice to say that in the line of sans culottes i have never loved any one but women pretty girls are pretty girls the deuce there s no objection to that as for the little one she receives you without her father s knowledge that s in the established order of things i have had adventures of that same sort myself more than one do you know what is done then one does not take the matter ferociously one does not precipitate himself into the tragic one does not make one s mind to marriage and m le maire with his scarf one simply behaves like a fellow of spirit one shows good sense slip along mortals don t marry you come and look up your grandfather who is a good natured fellow at bottom and who always has a few rolls of louis in an old drawer you say to him see here grandfather and the grandfather says that s a simple matter youth must amuse itself and old age must wear out i have been young you will be old come my boy you shall pass it on to your grandson here are two hundred pistoles amuse yourself deuce take it nothing better that s the way the affair should be treated you don t marry but that does no harm you understand me marius petrified and incapable of uttering a syllable made a sign with his head that he did not the old man burst out laughing winked his aged eye gave him a slap on the knee stared him full in the face with a mysterious and beaming air and said to him with the tenderest of shrugs of the shoulder booby make her your mistress marius turned pale he had understood nothing of what his grandfather had just said this twaddle about the rue blomet pamela the barracks the lancer had passed before marius like a dissolving view nothing of all that could bear any reference to cosette who was a lily the good man was wandering in his mind but this wandering terminated in words which marius did understand and which were a mortal insult to cosette those words make her your mistress entered the heart of the strict young man like a sword he rose picked up his hat which lay on the floor and walked to the door with a firm assured step there he turned round bowed deeply to his grandfather raised his head erect again and said five years ago you insulted my father to day you have insulted my wife i ask nothing more of you sir farewell father gillenormand utterly confounded opened his mouth extended his arms tried to rise and before he could utter a word the door closed once more and marius had disappeared the old man remained for several minutes motionless and as though struck by lightning without the power to speak or breathe as though a clenched fist grasped his throat at last he tore himself from his arm chair ran so far as a man can run at ninety one to the door opened it and cried help help his daughter made her appearance then the domestics he began again with a pitiful rattle run after him bring him back what have i done to him he is mad he is going away ah my god ah my god this time he will not come back he went to the window which looked out on the street threw it open with his aged and palsied hands leaned out more than half way while basque and nicolette held him behind and shouted marius marius marius marius but marius could no longer hear him for at that moment he was turning the corner of the rue saint louis the octogenarian raised his hands to his temples two or three times with an expression of anguish recoiled tottering and fell back into an arm chair pulseless voiceless tearless with quivering head and lips which moved with a stupid air with nothing in his eyes and nothing any longer in his heart except a gloomy and profound something which resembled night book ninth whither are they going chapter i jean valjean that same day towards four o clock in the afternoon jean valjean was sitting alone on the back side of one of the most solitary slopes in the champ de mars either from prudence or from a desire to meditate or simply in consequence of one of those insensible changes of habit which gradually introduce themselves into the existence of every one he now rarely went out with cosette he had on his workman s waistcoat and trousers of gray linen and his long visored cap concealed his countenance he was calm and happy now beside cosette that which had for a time alarmed and troubled him had been dissipated but for the last week or two anxieties of another nature had come up one day while walking on the boulevard he had caught sight of thénardier thanks to his disguise thénardier had not recognized him but since that day jean valjean had seen him repeatedly and he was now certain that thénardier was prowling about in their neighborhood this had been sufficient to make him come to a decision moreover paris was not tranquil political troubles presented this inconvenient feature for any one who had anything to conceal in his life that the police had grown very uneasy and very suspicious and that while seeking to ferret out a man like pépin or morey they might very readily discover a man like jean valjean jean valjean had made up his mind to quit paris and even france and go over to england he had warned cosette he wished to set out before the end of the week he had seated himself on the slope in the champ de mars turning over all sorts of thoughts in his mind thénardier the police the journey and the difficulty of procuring a passport he was troubled from all these points of view last of all an inexplicable circumstance which had just attracted his attention and from which he had not yet recovered had added to his state of alarm on the morning of that very day when he alone of the household was stirring while strolling in the garden before cosette s shutters were open he had suddenly perceived on the wall the following line engraved probably with a nail 16 rue de la verrerie this was perfectly fresh the grooves in the ancient black mortar were white a tuft of nettles at the foot of the wall was powdered with the fine fresh plaster this had probably been written on the preceding night what was this a signal for others a warning for himself in any case it was evident that the garden had been violated and that strangers had made their way into it he recalled the odd incidents which had already alarmed the household his mind was now filling in this canvas he took good care not to speak to cosette of the line written on the wall for fear of alarming her in the midst of his preoccupations he perceived from a shadow cast by the sun that some one had halted on the crest of the slope immediately behind him he was on the point of turning round when a paper folded in four fell upon his knees as though a hand had dropped it over his head he took the paper unfolded it and read these words written in large characters with a pencil move away from your house jean valjean sprang hastily to his feet there was no one on the slope he gazed all around him and perceived a creature larger than a child not so large as a man clad in a gray blouse and trousers of dust colored cotton velvet who was jumping over the parapet and who slipped into the moat of the champ de mars jean valjean returned home at once in a very thoughtful mood chapter ii marius marius had left m gillenormand in despair he had entered the house with very little hope and quitted it with immense despair however and those who have observed the depths of the human heart will understand this the officer the lancer the ninny cousin théodule had left no trace in his mind not the slightest the dramatic poet might apparently expect some complications from this revelation made point blank by the grandfather to the grandson but what the drama would gain thereby truth would lose marius was at an age when one believes nothing in the line of evil later on comes the age when one believes everything suspicions are nothing else than wrinkles early youth has none of them that which overwhelmed othello glides innocuous over candide suspect cosette there are hosts of crimes which marius could sooner have committed he began to wander about the streets the resource of those who suffer he thought of nothing so far as he could afterwards remember at two o clock in the morning he returned to courfeyrac s quarters and flung himself without undressing on his mattress the sun was shining brightly when he sank into that frightful leaden slumber which permits ideas to go and come in the brain when he awoke he saw courfeyrac enjolras feuilly and combeferre standing in the room with their hats on and all ready to go out courfeyrac said to him are you coming to general lamarque s funeral it seemed to him that courfeyrac was speaking chinese he went out some time after them he put in his pocket the pistols which javert had given him at the time of the adventure on the 3d of february and which had remained in his hands these pistols were still loaded it would be difficult to say what vague thought he had in his mind when he took them with him all day long he prowled about without knowing where he was going it rained at times he did not perceive it for his dinner he purchased a penny roll at a baker s put it in his pocket and forgot it it appears that he took a bath in the seine without being aware of it there are moments when a man has a furnace within his skull marius was passing through one of those moments he no longer hoped for anything this step he had taken since the preceding evening he waited for night with feverish impatience he had but one idea clearly before his mind this was that at nine o clock he should see cosette this last happiness now constituted his whole future after that gloom at intervals as he roamed through the most deserted boulevards it seemed to him that he heard strange noises in paris he thrust his head out of his revery and said is there fighting on hand at nightfall at nine o clock precisely as he had promised cosette he was in the rue plumet when he approached the grating he forgot everything it was forty eight hours since he had seen cosette he was about to behold her once more every other thought was effaced and he felt only a profound and unheard of joy those minutes in which one lives centuries always have this sovereign and wonderful property that at the moment when they are passing they fill the heart completely marius displaced the bar and rushed headlong into the garden cosette was not at the spot where she ordinarily waited for him he traversed the thicket and approached the recess near the flight of steps she is waiting for me there said he cosette was not there he raised his eyes and saw that the shutters of the house were closed he made the tour of the garden the garden was deserted then he returned to the house and rendered senseless by love intoxicated terrified exasperated with grief and uneasiness like a master who returns home at an evil hour he tapped on the shutters he knocked and knocked again at the risk of seeing the window open and her father s gloomy face make its appearance and demand what do you want this was nothing in comparison with what he dimly caught a glimpse of when he had rapped he lifted up his voice and called cosette cosette he cried cosette he repeated imperiously there was no reply all was over no one in the garden no one in the house marius fixed his despairing eyes on that dismal house which was as black and as silent as a tomb and far more empty he gazed at the stone seat on which he had passed so many adorable hours with cosette then he seated himself on the flight of steps his heart filled with sweetness and resolution he blessed his love in the depths of his thought and he said to himself that since cosette was gone all that there was left for him was to die all at once he heard a voice which seemed to proceed from the street and which was calling to him through the trees mr marius he started to his feet hey said he mr marius are you there yes mr marius went on the voice your friends are waiting for you at the barricade of the rue de la chanvrerie this voice was not wholly unfamiliar to him it resembled the hoarse rough voice of éponine marius hastened to the gate thrust aside the movable bar passed his head through the aperture and saw some one who appeared to him to be a young man disappearing at a run into the gloom chapter iii m mabeuf jean valjean s purse was of no use to m mabeuf m mabeuf in his venerable infantile austerity had not accepted the gift of the stars he had not admitted that a star could coin itself into louis d or he had not divined that what had fallen from heaven had come from gavroche he had taken the purse to the police commissioner of the quarter as a lost article placed by the finder at the disposal of claimants the purse was actually lost it is unnecessary to say that no one claimed it and that it did not succor m mabeuf moreover m mabeuf had continued his downward course his experiments on indigo had been no more successful in the jardin des plantes than in his garden at austerlitz the year before he had owed his housekeeper s wages now as we have seen he owed three quarters of his rent the pawnshop had sold the plates of his flora after the expiration of thirteen months some coppersmith had made stewpans of them his copper plates gone and being unable to complete even the incomplete copies of his flora which were in his possession he had disposed of the text at a miserable price as waste paper to a second hand bookseller nothing now remained to him of his life s work he set to work to eat up the money for these copies when he saw that this wretched resource was becoming exhausted he gave up his garden and allowed it to run to waste before this a long time before he had given up his two eggs and the morsel of beef which he ate from time to time he dined on bread and potatoes he had sold the last of his furniture then all duplicates of his bedding his clothing and his blankets then his herbariums and prints but he still retained his most precious books many of which were of the greatest rarity among others les quadrins historiques de la bible edition of 1560 la concordance des bibles by pierre de besse les marguerites de la marguerite of jean de la haye with a dedication to the queen of navarre the book de la charge et dignité de l ambassadeur by the sieur de villiers hotman a florilegium rabbinicum of 1644 a tibullus of 1567 with this magnificent inscription venetiis in ædibus manutianis and lastly a diogenes laertius printed at lyons in 1644 which contained the famous variant of the manuscript 411 thirteenth century of the vatican and those of the two manuscripts of venice 393 and 394 consulted with such fruitful results by henri estienne and all the passages in doric dialect which are only found in the celebrated manuscript of the twelfth century belonging to the naples library m mabeuf never had any fire in his chamber and went to bed at sundown in order not to consume any candles it seemed as though he had no longer any neighbors people avoided him when he went out he perceived the fact the wretchedness of a child interests a mother the wretchedness of a young man interests a young girl the wretchedness of an old man interests no one it is of all distresses the coldest still father mabeuf had not entirely lost his childlike serenity his eyes acquired some vivacity when they rested on his books and he smiled when he gazed at the diogenes laertius which was a unique copy his bookcase with glass doors was the only piece of furniture which he had kept beyond what was strictly indispensable one day mother plutarque said to him i have no money to buy any dinner what she called dinner was a loaf of bread and four or five potatoes on credit suggested m mabeuf you know well that people refuse me m mabeuf opened his bookcase took a long look at all his books one after another as a father obliged to decimate his children would gaze upon them before making a choice then seized one hastily put it in under his arm and went out he returned two hours later without anything under his arm laid thirty sous on the table and said you will get something for dinner from that moment forth mother plutarque saw a sombre veil which was never more lifted descend over the old man s candid face on the following day on the day after and on the day after that it had to be done again m mabeuf went out with a book and returned with a coin as the second hand dealers perceived that he was forced to sell they purchased of him for twenty sous that for which he had paid twenty francs sometimes at those very shops volume by volume the whole library went the same road he said at times but i am eighty as though he cherished some secret hope that he should arrive at the end of his days before reaching the end of his books his melancholy increased once however he had a pleasure he had gone out with a robert estienne which he had sold for thirty five sous under the quai malaquais and he returned with an aldus which he had bought for forty sous in the rue des grès i owe five sous he said beaming on mother plutarque that day he had no dinner he belonged to the horticultural society his destitution became known there the president of the society came to see him promised to speak to the minister of agriculture and commerce about him and did so why what exclaimed the minister i should think so an old savant a botanist an inoffensive man something must be done for him on the following day m mabeuf received an invitation to dine with the minister trembling with joy he showed the letter to mother plutarque we are saved said he on the day appointed he went to the minister s house he perceived that his ragged cravat his long square coat and his waxed shoes astonished the ushers no one spoke to him not even the minister about ten o clock in the evening while he was still waiting for a word he heard the minister s wife a beautiful woman in a low necked gown whom he had not ventured to approach inquire who is that old gentleman he returned home on foot at midnight in a driving rain storm he had sold an elzevir to pay for a carriage in which to go thither he had acquired the habit of reading a few pages in his diogenes laertius every night before he went to bed he knew enough greek to enjoy the peculiarities of the text which he owned he had now no other enjoyment several weeks passed all at once mother plutarque fell ill there is one thing sadder than having no money with which to buy bread at the baker s and that is having no money to purchase drugs at the apothecary s one evening the doctor had ordered a very expensive potion and the malady was growing worse a nurse was required m mabeuf opened his bookcase there was nothing there the last volume had taken its departure all that was left to him was diogenes laertius he put this unique copy under his arm and went out it was the 4th of june 1832 he went to the porte saint jacques to royal s successor and returned with one hundred francs he laid the pile of five franc pieces on the old serving woman s nightstand and returned to his chamber without saying a word on the following morning at dawn he seated himself on the overturned post in his garden and he could be seen over the top of the hedge sitting the whole morning motionless with drooping head his eyes vaguely fixed on the withered flower beds it rained at intervals the old man did not seem to perceive the fact in the afternoon extraordinary noises broke out in paris they resembled shots and the clamors of a multitude father mabeuf raised his head he saw a gardener passing and inquired what is it the gardener spade on back replied in the most unconcerned tone it is the riots what riots yes they are fighting why are they fighting ah good heavens ejaculated the gardener in what direction went on m mabeuf in the neighborhood of the arsenal father mabeuf went to his room took his hat mechanically sought for a book to place under his arm found none said ah truly and went off with a bewildered air book tenth the 5th of june 1832 chapter i the surface of the question of what is revolt composed of nothing and of everything of an electricity disengaged little by little of a flame suddenly darting forth of a wandering force of a passing breath this breath encounters heads which speak brains which dream souls which suffer passions which burn wretchedness which howls and bears them away whither at random athwart the state the laws athwart prosperity and the insolence of others irritated convictions embittered enthusiasms agitated indignations instincts of war which have been repressed youthful courage which has been exalted generous blindness curiosity the taste for change the thirst for the unexpected the sentiment which causes one to take pleasure in reading the posters for the new play and love the prompter s whistle at the theatre the vague hatreds rancors disappointments every vanity which thinks that destiny has bankrupted it discomfort empty dreams ambitions that are hedged about whoever hopes for a downfall some outcome in short at the very bottom the rabble that mud which catches fire such are the elements of revolt that which is grandest and that which is basest the beings who prowl outside of all bounds awaiting an occasion bohemians vagrants vagabonds of the cross roads those who sleep at night in a desert of houses with no other roof than the cold clouds of heaven those who each day demand their bread from chance and not from toil the unknown of poverty and nothingness the bare armed the bare footed belong to revolt whoever cherishes in his soul a secret revolt against any deed whatever on the part of the state of life or of fate is ripe for riot and as soon as it makes its appearance he begins to quiver and to feel himself borne away with the whirlwind revolt is a sort of waterspout in the social atmosphere which forms suddenly in certain conditions of temperature and which as it eddies about mounts descends thunders tears razes crushes demolishes uproots bearing with it great natures and small the strong man and the feeble mind the tree trunk and the stalk of straw woe to him whom it bears away as well as to him whom it strikes it breaks the one against the other it communicates to those whom it seizes an indescribable and extraordinary power it fills the first comer with the force of events it converts everything into projectiles it makes a cannon ball of a rough stone and a general of a porter if we are to believe certain oracles of crafty political views a little revolt is desirable from the point of view of power system revolt strengthens those governments which it does not overthrow it puts the army to the test it consecrates the bourgeoisie it draws out the muscles of the police it demonstrates the force of the social framework it is an exercise in gymnastics it is almost hygiene power is in better health after a revolt as a man is after a good rubbing down revolt thirty years ago was regarded from still other points of view there is for everything a theory which proclaims itself good sense philintus against alcestis mediation offered between the false and the true explanation admonition rather haughty extenuation which because it is mingled with blame and excuse thinks itself wisdom and is often only pedantry a whole political school called the golden mean has been the outcome of this as between cold water and hot water it is the lukewarm water party this school with its false depth all on the surface which dissects effects without going back to first causes chides from its height of a demi science the agitation of the public square if we listen to this school the riots which complicated the affair of 1830 deprived that great event of a portion of its purity the revolution of july had been a fine popular gale abruptly followed by blue sky they made the cloudy sky reappear they caused that revolution at first so remarkable for its unanimity to degenerate into a quarrel in the revolution of july as in all progress accomplished by fits and starts there had been secret fractures these riots rendered them perceptible it might have been said ah this is broken after the revolution of july one was sensible only of deliverance after the riots one was conscious of a catastrophe all revolt closes the shops depresses the funds throws the exchange into consternation suspends commerce clogs business precipitates failures no more money private fortunes rendered uneasy public credit shaken industry disconcerted capital withdrawing work at a discount fear everywhere counter shocks in every town hence gulfs it has been calculated that the first day of a riot costs france twenty millions the second day forty the third sixty a three days uprising costs one hundred and twenty millions that is to say if only the financial result be taken into consideration it is equivalent to a disaster a shipwreck or a lost battle which should annihilate a fleet of sixty ships of the line no doubt historically uprisings have their beauty the war of the pavements is no less grandiose and no less pathetic than the war of thickets in the one there is the soul of forests in the other the heart of cities the one has jean chouan the other has a jeanne revolts have illuminated with a red glare all the most original points of the parisian character generosity devotion stormy gayety students proving that bravery forms part of intelligence the national guard invincible bivouacs of shopkeepers fortresses of street urchins contempt of death on the part of passers by schools and legions clashed together after all between the combatants there was only a difference of age the race is the same it is the same stoical men who died at the age of twenty for their ideas at forty for their families the army always a sad thing in civil wars opposed prudence to audacity uprisings while proving popular intrepidity also educated the courage of the bourgeois this is well but is all this worth the bloodshed and to the bloodshed add the future darkness progress compromised uneasiness among the best men honest liberals in despair foreign absolutism happy in these wounds dealt to revolution by its own hand the vanquished of 1830 triumphing and saying we told you so add paris enlarged possibly but france most assuredly diminished add for all must needs be told the massacres which have too often dishonored the victory of order grown ferocious over liberty gone mad to sum up all uprisings have been disastrous thus speaks that approximation to wisdom with which the bourgeoisie that approximation to the people so willingly contents itself for our parts we reject this word uprisings as too large and consequently as too convenient we make a distinction between one popular movement and another popular movement we do not inquire whether an uprising costs as much as a battle why a battle in the first place here the question of war comes up is war less of a scourge than an uprising is of a calamity and then are all uprisings calamities and what if the revolt of july did cost a hundred and twenty millions the establishment of philip v in spain cost france two milliards even at the same price we should prefer the 14th of july however we reject these figures which appear to be reasons and which are only words an uprising being given we examine it by itself in all that is said by the doctrinarian objection above presented there is no question of anything but effect we seek the cause we will be explicit chapter ii the root of the matter there is such a thing as an uprising and there is such a thing as insurrection these are two separate phases of wrath one is in the wrong the other is in the right in democratic states the only ones which are founded on justice it sometimes happens that the fraction usurps then the whole rises and the necessary claim of its rights may proceed as far as resort to arms in all questions which result from collective sovereignty the war of the whole against the fraction is insurrection the attack of the fraction against the whole is revolt according as the tuileries contain a king or the convention they are justly or unjustly attacked the same cannon pointed against the populace is wrong on the 10th of august and right on the 14th of vendémiaire alike in appearance fundamentally different in reality the swiss defend the false bonaparte defends the true that which universal suffrage has effected in its liberty and in its sovereignty cannot be undone by the street it is the same in things pertaining purely to civilization the instinct of the masses clear sighted to day may be troubled to morrow the same fury legitimate when directed against terray and absurd when directed against turgot the destruction of machines the pillage of warehouses the breaking of rails the demolition of docks the false routes of multitudes the refusal by the people of justice to progress ramus assassinated by students rousseau driven out of switzerland and stoned that is revolt israel against moses athens against phocian rome against cicero that is an uprising paris against the bastille that is insurrection the soldiers against alexander the sailors against christopher columbus this is the same revolt impious revolt why because alexander is doing for asia with the sword that which christopher columbus is doing for america with the compass alexander like columbus is finding a world these gifts of a world to civilization are such augmentations of light that all resistance in that case is culpable sometimes the populace counterfeits fidelity to itself the masses are traitors to the people is there for example anything stranger than that long and bloody protest of dealers in contraband salt a legitimate chronic revolt which at the decisive moment on the day of salvation at the very hour of popular victory espouses the throne turns into chouannerie and from having been an insurrection against becomes an uprising for sombre masterpieces of ignorance the contraband salt dealer escapes the royal gibbets and with a rope s end round his neck mounts the white cockade death to the salt duties brings forth long live the king the assassins of saint barthélemy the cut throats of september the manslaughterers of avignon the assassins of coligny the assassins of madam lamballe the assassins of brune miquelets verdets cadenettes the companions of jéhu the chevaliers of brassard behold an uprising la vendée is a grand catholic uprising the sound of right in movement is recognizable it does not always proceed from the trembling of excited masses there are mad rages there are cracked bells all tocsins do not give out the sound of bronze the brawl of passions and ignorances is quite another thing from the shock of progress show me in what direction you are going rise if you will but let it be that you may grow great there is no insurrection except in a forward direction any other sort of rising is bad every violent step towards the rear is a revolt to retreat is to commit a deed of violence against the human race insurrection is a fit of rage on the part of truth the pavements which the uprising disturbs give forth the spark of right these pavements bequeath to the uprising only their mud danton against louis xiv is insurrection hébert against danton is revolt hence it results that if insurrection in given cases may be as lafayette says the most holy of duties an uprising may be the most fatal of crimes there is also a difference in the intensity of heat insurrection is often a volcano revolt is often only a fire of straw revolt as we have said is sometimes found among those in power polignac is a rioter camille desmoulins is one of the governing powers insurrection is sometimes resurrection the solution of everything by universal suffrage being an absolutely modern fact and all history anterior to this fact being for the space of four thousand years filled with violated right and the suffering of peoples each epoch of history brings with it that protest of which it is capable under the cæsars there was no insurrection but there was juvenal the facit indignatio replaces the gracchi under the cæsars there is the exile to syene there is also the man of the annales we do not speak of the immense exile of patmos who on his part also overwhelms the real world with a protest in the name of the ideal world who makes of his vision an enormous satire and casts on rome nineveh on rome babylon on rome sodom the flaming reflection of the apocalypse john on his rock is the sphinx on its pedestal we may understand him he is a jew and it is hebrew but the man who writes the annales is of the latin race let us rather say he is a roman as the neros reign in a black way they should be painted to match the work of the graving tool alone would be too pale there must be poured into the channel a concentrated prose which bites despots count for something in the question of philosophers a word that is chained is a terrible word the writer doubles and trebles his style when silence is imposed on a nation by its master from this silence there arises a certain mysterious plenitude which filters into thought and there congeals into bronze the compression of history produces conciseness in the historian the granite solidity of such and such a celebrated prose is nothing but the accumulation effected by the tyrant tyranny constrains the writer to conditions of diameter which are augmentations of force the ciceronian period which hardly sufficed for verres would be blunted on caligula the less spread of sail in the phrase the more intensity in the blow tacitus thinks with all his might the honesty of a great heart condensed in justice and truth overwhelms as with lightning be it remarked in passing that tacitus is not historically superposed upon cæsar the tiberii were reserved for him cæsar and tacitus are two successive phenomena a meeting between whom seems to be mysteriously avoided by the one who when he sets the centuries on the stage regulates the entrances and the exits cæsar is great tacitus is great god spares these two greatnesses by not allowing them to clash with one another the guardian of justice in striking cæsar might strike too hard and be unjust god does not will it the great wars of africa and spain the pirates of sicily destroyed civilization introduced into gaul into britanny into germany all this glory covers the rubicon there is here a sort of delicacy of the divine justice hesitating to let loose upon the illustrious usurper the formidable historian sparing cæsar tacitus and according extenuating circumstances to genius certainly despotism remains despotism even under the despot of genius there is corruption under all illustrious tyrants but the moral pest is still more hideous under infamous tyrants in such reigns nothing veils the shame and those who make examples tacitus as well as juvenal slap this ignominy which cannot reply in the face more usefully in the presence of all humanity rome smells worse under vitellius than under sylla under claudius and under domitian there is a deformity of baseness corresponding to the repulsiveness of the tyrant the villainy of slaves is a direct product of the despot a miasma exhales from these cowering consciences wherein the master is reflected public powers are unclean hearts are small consciences are dull souls are like vermin thus it is under caracalla thus it is under commodus thus it is under heliogabalus while from the roman senate under cæsar there comes nothing but the odor of the dung which is peculiar to the eyries of the eagles hence the advent apparently tardy of the tacituses and the juvenals it is in the hour for evidence that the demonstrator makes his appearance but juvenal and tacitus like isaiah in biblical times like dante in the middle ages is man riot and insurrection are the multitude which is sometimes right and sometimes wrong in the majority of cases riot proceeds from a material fact insurrection is always a moral phenomenon riot is masaniello insurrection spartacus insurrection borders on mind riot on the stomach gaster grows irritated but gaster assuredly is not always in the wrong in questions of famine riot buzançais for example holds a true pathetic and just point of departure nevertheless it remains a riot why it is because right at bottom it was wrong in form shy although in the right violent although strong it struck at random it walked like a blind elephant it left behind it the corpses of old men of women and of children it wished the blood of inoffensive and innocent persons without knowing why the nourishment of the people is a good object to massacre them is a bad means all armed protests even the most legitimate even that of the 10th of august even that of july 14th begin with the same troubles before the right gets set free there is foam and tumult in the beginning the insurrection is a riot just as a river is a torrent ordinarily it ends in that ocean revolution sometimes however coming from those lofty mountains which dominate the moral horizon justice wisdom reason right formed of the pure snow of the ideal after a long fall from rock to rock after having reflected the sky in its transparency and increased by a hundred affluents in the majestic mien of triumph insurrection is suddenly lost in some quagmire as the rhine is in a swamp all this is of the past the future is another thing universal suffrage has this admirable property that it dissolves riot in its inception and by giving the vote to insurrection it deprives it of its arms the disappearance of wars of street wars as well as of wars on the frontiers such is the inevitable progression whatever to day may be to morrow will be peace however insurrection riot and points of difference between the former and the latter the bourgeois properly speaking knows nothing of such shades in his mind all is sedition rebellion pure and simple the revolt of the dog against his master an attempt to bite whom must be punished by the chain and the kennel barking snapping until such day as the head of the dog suddenly enlarged is outlined vaguely in the gloom face to face with the lion then the bourgeois shouts long live the people this explanation given what does the movement of june 1832 signify so far as history is concerned is it a revolt is it an insurrection it may happen to us in placing this formidable event on the stage to say revolt now and then but merely to distinguish superficial facts and always preserving the distinction between revolt the form and insurrection the foundation this movement of 1832 had in its rapid outbreak and in its melancholy extinction so much grandeur that even those who see in it only an uprising never refer to it otherwise than with respect for them it is like a relic of 1830 excited imaginations say they are not to be calmed in a day a revolution cannot be cut off short it must needs undergo some undulations before it returns to a state of rest like a mountain sinking into the plain there are no alps without their jura nor pyrenees without the asturias this pathetic crisis of contemporary history which the memory of parisians calls the epoch of the riots is certainly a characteristic hour amid the stormy hours of this century a last word before we enter on the recital the facts which we are about to relate belong to that dramatic and living reality which the historian sometimes neglects for lack of time and space there nevertheless we insist upon it is life palpitation human tremor petty details as we think we have already said are so to speak the foliage of great events and are lost in the distance of history the epoch surnamed of the riots abounds in details of this nature judicial inquiries have not revealed and perhaps have not sounded the depths for another reason than history we shall therefore bring to light among the known and published peculiarities things which have not heretofore been known about facts over which have passed the forgetfulness of some and the death of others the majority of the actors in these gigantic scenes have disappeared beginning with the very next day they held their peace but of what we shall relate we shall be able to say we have seen this we alter a few names for history relates and does not inform against but the deed which we shall paint will be genuine in accordance with the conditions of the book which we are now writing we shall show only one side and one episode and certainly the least known at that of the two days the 5th and the 6th of june 1832 but we shall do it in such wise that the reader may catch a glimpse beneath the gloomy veil which we are about to lift of the real form of this frightful public adventure chapter iii a burial an occasion to be born again in the spring of 1832 although the cholera had been chilling all minds for the last three months and had cast over their agitation an indescribable and gloomy pacification paris had already long been ripe for commotion as we have said the great city resembles a piece of artillery when it is loaded it suffices for a spark to fall and the shot is discharged in june 1832 the spark was the death of general lamarque lamarque was a man of renown and of action he had had in succession under the empire and under the restoration the sorts of bravery requisite for the two epochs the bravery of the battle field and the bravery of the tribune he was as eloquent as he had been valiant a sword was discernible in his speech like foy his predecessor after upholding the command he upheld liberty he sat between the left and the extreme left beloved of the people because he accepted the chances of the future beloved of the populace because he had served the emperor well he was in company with comtes gérard and drouet one of napoleon s marshals in petto the treaties of 1815 removed him as a personal offence he hated wellington with a downright hatred which pleased the multitude and for seventeen years he majestically preserved the sadness of waterloo paying hardly any attention to intervening events in his death agony at his last hour he clasped to his breast a sword which had been presented to him by the officers of the hundred days napoleon had died uttering the word army lamarque uttering the word country his death which was expected was dreaded by the people as a loss and by the government as an occasion this death was an affliction like everything that is bitter affliction may turn to revolt this is what took place on the preceding evening and on the morning of the 5th of june the day appointed for lamarque s burial the faubourg saint antoine which the procession was to touch at assumed a formidable aspect this tumultuous network of streets was filled with rumors they armed themselves as best they might joiners carried off door weights of their establishment to break down doors one of them had made himself a dagger of a stocking weaver s hook by breaking off the hook and sharpening the stump another who was in a fever to attack slept wholly dressed for three days a carpenter named lombier met a comrade who asked him whither are you going eh well i have no weapons what then i m going to my timber yard to get my compasses what for i don t know said lombier a certain jacqueline an expeditious man accosted some passing artisans come here you he treated them to ten sous worth of wine and said have you work no go to filspierre between the barrière charonne and the barrière montreuil and you will find work at filspierre s they found cartridges and arms certain well known leaders were going the rounds that is to say running from one house to another to collect their men at barthélemy s near the barrière du trône at capel s near the petit chapeau the drinkers accosted each other with a grave air they were heard to say have you your pistol under my blouse and you under my shirt in the rue traversière in front of the bland workshop and in the yard of the maison brulée in front of tool maker bernier s groups whispered together among them was observed a certain mavot who never remained more than a week in one shop as the masters always discharged him because they were obliged to dispute with him every day mavot was killed on the following day at the barricade of the rue ménilmontant pretot who was destined to perish also in the struggle seconded mavot and to the question what is your object he replied insurrection workmen assembled at the corner of the rue de bercy waited for a certain lemarin the revolutionary agent for the faubourg saint marceau watchwords were exchanged almost publicly on the 5th of june accordingly a day of mingled rain and sun general lamarque s funeral procession traversed paris with official military pomp somewhat augmented through precaution two battalions with draped drums and reversed arms ten thousand national guards with their swords at their sides escorted the coffin the hearse was drawn by young men the officers of the invalides came immediately behind it bearing laurel branches then came an innumerable strange agitated multitude the sectionaries of the friends of the people the law school the medical school refugees of all nationalities and spanish italian german and polish flags tricolored horizontal banners every possible sort of banner children waving green boughs stone cutters and carpenters who were on strike at the moment printers who were recognizable by their paper caps marching two by two three by three uttering cries nearly all of them brandishing sticks some brandishing sabres without order and yet with a single soul now a tumultuous rout again a column squads chose themselves leaders a man armed with a pair of pistols in full view seemed to pass the host in review and the files separated before him on the side alleys of the boulevards in the branches of the trees on balconies in windows on the roofs swarmed the heads of men women and children all eyes were filled with anxiety an armed throng was passing and a terrified throng looked on the government on its side was taking observations it observed with its hand on its sword four squadrons of carabineers could be seen in the place louis xv in their saddles with their trumpets at their head cartridge boxes filled and muskets loaded all in readiness to march in the latin country and at the jardin des plantes the municipal guard echelonned from street to street at the halle aux vins a squadron of dragoons at the grève half of the 12th light infantry the other half being at the bastille the 6th dragoons at the célestins and the courtyard of the louvre full of artillery the remainder of the troops were confined to their barracks without reckoning the regiments of the environs of paris power being uneasy held suspended over the menacing multitude twenty four thousand soldiers in the city and thirty thousand in the banlieue divers reports were in circulation in the cortège legitimist tricks were hinted at they spoke of the duc de reichstadt whom god had marked out for death at that very moment when the populace were designating him for the empire one personage whose name has remained unknown announced that at a given hour two overseers who had been won over would throw open the doors of a factory of arms to the people that which predominated on the uncovered brows of the majority of those present was enthusiasm mingled with dejection here and there also in that multitude given over to such violent but noble emotions there were visible genuine visages of criminals and ignoble mouths which said let us plunder there are certain agitations which stir up the bottoms of marshes and make clouds of mud rise through the water a phenomenon to which well drilled policemen are no strangers the procession proceeded with feverish slowness from the house of the deceased by way of the boulevards as far as the bastille it rained from time to time the rain mattered nothing to that throng many incidents the coffin borne round the vendome column stones thrown at the duc de fitz james who was seen on a balcony with his hat on his head the gallic cock torn from a popular flag and dragged in the mire a policeman wounded with a blow from a sword at the porte saint martin an officer of the 12th light infantry saying aloud i am a republican the polytechnic school coming up unexpectedly against orders to remain at home the shouts of long live the polytechnique long live the republic marked the passage of the funeral train at the bastille long files of curious and formidable people who descended from the faubourg saint antoine effected a junction with the procession and a certain terrible seething began to agitate the throng one man was heard to say to another do you see that fellow with a red beard he s the one who will give the word when we are to fire it appears that this red beard was present at another riot the quénisset affair entrusted with this same function the hearse passed the bastille traversed the small bridge and reached the esplanade of the bridge of austerlitz there it halted the crowd surveyed at that moment with a bird seye view would have presented the aspect of a comet whose head was on the esplanade and whose tail spread out over the quai bourdon covered the bastille and was prolonged on the boulevard as far as the porte saint martin a circle was traced around the hearse the vast rout held their peace lafayette spoke and bade lamarque farewell this was a touching and august instant all heads uncovered all hearts beat high all at once a man on horseback clad in black made his appearance in the middle of the group with a red flag others say with a pike surmounted with a red liberty cap lafayette turned aside his head exelmans quitted the procession this red flag raised a storm and disappeared in the midst of it from the boulevard bourdon to the bridge of austerlitz one of those clamors which resemble billows stirred the multitude two prodigious shouts went up lamarque to the pantheon lafayette to the town hall some young men amid the declamations of the throng harnessed themselves and began to drag lamarque in the hearse across the bridge of austerlitz and lafayette in a hackney coach along the quai morland in the crowd which surrounded and cheered lafayette it was noticed that a german showed himself named ludwig snyder who died a centenarian afterwards who had also been in the war of 1776 and who had fought at trenton under washington and at brandywine under lafayette in the meantime the municipal cavalry on the left bank had been set in motion and came to bar the bridge on the right bank the dragoons emerged from the célestins and deployed along the quai morland the men who were dragging lafayette suddenly caught sight of them at the corner of the quay and shouted the dragoons the dragoons advanced at a walk in silence with their pistols in their holsters their swords in their scabbards their guns slung in their leather sockets with an air of gloomy expectation they halted two hundred paces from the little bridge the carriage in which sat lafayette advanced to them their ranks opened and allowed it to pass and then closed behind it at that moment the dragoons and the crowd touched the women fled in terror what took place during that fatal minute no one can say it is the dark moment when two clouds come together some declare that a blast of trumpets sounding the charge was heard in the direction of the arsenal others that a blow from a dagger was given by a child to a dragoon the fact is that three shots were suddenly discharged the first killed cholet chief of the squadron the second killed an old deaf woman who was in the act of closing her window the third singed the shoulder of an officer a woman screamed they are beginning too soon and all at once a squadron of dragoons which had remained in the barracks up to this time was seen to debouch at a gallop with bared swords through the rue bassompierre and the boulevard bourdon sweeping all before them then all is said the tempest is loosed stones rain down a fusillade breaks forth many precipitate themselves to the bottom of the bank and pass the small arm of the seine now filled in the timber yards of the isle louviers that vast citadel ready to hand bristle with combatants stakes are torn up pistol shots fired a barricade begun the young men who are thrust back pass the austerlitz bridge with the hearse at a run and the municipal guard the carabineers rush up the dragoons ply their swords the crowd disperses in all directions a rumor of war flies to all four quarters of paris men shout to arms they run tumble down flee resist wrath spreads abroad the riot as wind spreads a fire chapter iv the ebullitions of former days nothing is more extraordinary than the first breaking out of a riot everything bursts forth everywhere at once was it foreseen yes was it prepared no whence comes it from the pavements whence falls it from the clouds here insurrection assumes the character of a plot there of an improvisation the first comer seizes a current of the throng and leads it whither he wills a beginning full of terror in which is mingled a sort of formidable gayety first come clamors the shops are closed the displays of the merchants disappear then come isolated shots people flee blows from gun stocks beat against portes cochères servants can be heard laughing in the courtyards of houses and saying there s going to be a row a quarter of an hour had not elapsed when this is what was taking place at twenty different spots in paris at once in the rue sainte croix de la bretonnerie twenty young men bearded and with long hair entered a dram shop and emerged a moment later carrying a horizontal tricolored flag covered with crape and having at their head three men armed one with a sword one with a gun and the third with a pike in the rue des nonaindières a very well dressed bourgeois who had a prominent belly a sonorous voice a bald head a lofty brow a black beard and one of these stiff mustaches which will not lie flat offered cartridges publicly to passers by in the rue saint pierre montmartre men with bare arms carried about a black flag on which could be read in white letters this inscription republic or death in the rue des jeûneurs rue du cadran rue montorgueil rue mandar groups appeared waving flags on which could be distinguished in gold letters the word section with a number one of these flags was red and blue with an almost imperceptible stripe of white between they pillaged a factory of small arms on the boulevard saint martin and three armorers shops the first in the rue beaubourg the second in the rue michel le comte the other in the rue du temple in a few minutes the thousand hands of the crowd had seized and carried off two hundred and thirty guns nearly all double barrelled sixty four swords and eighty three pistols in order to provide more arms one man took the gun the other the bayonet opposite the quai de la grève young men armed with muskets installed themselves in the houses of some women for the purpose of firing one of them had a flint lock they rang entered and set about making cartridges one of these women relates i did not know what cartridges were it was my husband who told me one cluster broke into a curiosity shop in the rue des vieilles haudriettes and seized yataghans and turkish arms the body of a mason who had been killed by a gun shot lay in the rue de la perle and then on the right bank the left bank on the quays on the boulevards in the latin country in the quarter of the halles panting men artisans students members of sections read proclamations and shouted to arms broke street lanterns unharnessed carriages unpaved the streets broke in the doors of houses uprooted trees rummaged cellars rolled out hogsheads heaped up paving stones rough slabs furniture and planks and made barricades they forced the bourgeois to assist them in this they entered the dwellings of women they forced them to hand over the swords and guns of their absent husbands and they wrote on the door with whiting the arms have been delivered some signed their names to receipts for the guns and swords and said send for them to morrow at the mayor s office they disarmed isolated sentinels and national guardsmen in the streets on their way to the townhall they tore the epaulets from officers in the rue du cimitière saint nicholas an officer of the national guard on being pursued by a crowd armed with clubs and foils took refuge with difficulty in a house whence he was only able to emerge at nightfall and in disguise in the quartier saint jacques the students swarmed out of their hotels and ascended the rue saint hyacinthe to the café du progrèss or descended to the café des sept billards in the rue des mathurins there in front of the door young men mounted on the stone corner posts distributed arms they plundered the timber yard in the rue transnonain in order to obtain material for barricades on a single point the inhabitants resisted at the corner of the rue sainte avoye and the rue simon le franc where they destroyed the barricade with their own hands at a single point the insurgents yielded they abandoned a barricade begun in the rue de temple after having fired on a detachment of the national guard and fled through the rue de la corderie the detachment picked up in the barricade a red flag a package of cartridges and three hundred pistol balls the national guardsmen tore up the flag and carried off its tattered remains on the points of their bayonets all that we are here relating slowly and successively took place simultaneously at all points of the city in the midst of a vast tumult like a mass of tongues of lightning in one clap of thunder in less than an hour twenty seven barricades sprang out of the earth in the quarter of the halles alone in the centre was that famous house no 50 which was the fortress of jeanne and her six hundred companions and which flanked on the one hand by a barricade at saint merry and on the other by a barricade of the rue maubuée commanded three streets the rue des arcis the rue saint martin and the rue aubry le boucher which it faced the barricades at right angles fell back the one of the rue montorgueil on the grande truanderie the other of the rue geoffroy langevin on the rue sainte avoye without reckoning innumerable barricades in twenty other quarters of paris in the marais at mont sainte geneviève one in the rue ménilmontant where was visible a porte cochère torn from its hinges another near the little bridge of the hôtel dieu made with an écossais which had been unharnessed and overthrown three hundred paces from the prefecture of police at the barricade of the rue des ménétriers a well dressed man distributed money to the workmen at the barricade of the rue grenetat a horseman made his appearance and handed to the one who seemed to be the commander of the barricade what had the appearance of a roll of silver here said he this is to pay expenses wine et cætera a light haired young man without a cravat went from barricade to barricade carrying pass words another with a naked sword a blue police cap on his head placed sentinels in the interior beyond the barricades the wine shops and porters lodges were converted into guard houses otherwise the riot was conducted after the most scientific military tactics the narrow uneven sinuous streets full of angles and turns were admirably chosen the neighborhood of the halles in particular a network of streets more intricate than a forest the society of the friends of the people had it was said undertaken to direct the insurrection in the quartier sainte avoye a man killed in the rue du ponceau who was searched had on his person a plan of paris that which had really undertaken the direction of the uprising was a sort of strange impetuosity which was in the air the insurrection had abruptly built barricades with one hand and with the other seized nearly all the posts of the garrison in less than three hours like a train of powder catching fire the insurgents had invaded and occupied on the right bank the arsenal the mayoralty of the place royale the whole of the marais the popincourt arms manufactory la galiote the château d eau and all the streets near the halles on the left bank the barracks of the veterans sainte pélagie the place maubert the powder magazine of the deux moulins and all the barriers at five o clock in the evening they were masters of the bastille of the lingerie of the blancs manteaux their scouts had reached the place des victoires and menaced the bank the petits pères barracks and the post office a third of paris was in the hands of the rioters the conflict had been begun on a gigantic scale at all points and as a result of the disarming domiciliary visits and armorers shops hastily invaded was that the combat which had begun with the throwing of stones was continued with gun shots about six o clock in the evening the passage du saumon became the field of battle the uprising was at one end the troops were at the other they fired from one gate to the other an observer a dreamer the author of this book who had gone to get a near view of this volcano found himself in the passage between the two fires all that he had to protect him from the bullets was the swell of the two half columns which separate the shops he remained in this delicate situation for nearly half an hour meanwhile the call to arms was beaten the national guard armed in haste the legions emerged from the mayoralities the regiments from their barracks opposite the passage de l ancre a drummer received a blow from a dagger another in the rue du cygne was assailed by thirty young men who broke his instrument and took away his sword another was killed in the rue grenier saint lazare in the rue michel le comte three officers fell dead one after the other many of the municipal guards on being wounded in the rue des lombards retreated in front of the cour batave a detachment of national guards found a red flag bearing the following inscription republican revolution no 127 was this a revolution in fact the insurrection had made of the centre of paris a sort of inextricable tortuous colossal citadel there was the hearth there evidently was the question all the rest was nothing but skirmishes the proof that all would be decided there lay in the fact that there was no fighting going on there as yet in some regiments the soldiers were uncertain which added to the fearful uncertainty of the crisis they recalled the popular ovation which had greeted the neutrality of the 53d of the line in july 1830 two intrepid men tried in great wars the marshal lobau and general bugeaud were in command bugeaud under lobau enormous patrols composed of battalions of the line enclosed in entire companies of the national guard and preceded by a commissary of police wearing his scarf of office went to reconnoitre the streets in rebellion the insurgents on their side placed videttes at the corners of all open spaces and audaciously sent their patrols outside the barricades each side was watching the other the government with an army in its hand hesitated the night was almost upon them and the saint merry tocsin began to make itself heard the minister of war at that time marshal soult who had seen austerlitz regarded this with a gloomy air these old sailors accustomed to correct manouvres and having as resource and guide only tactics that compass of battles are utterly disconcerted in the presence of that immense foam which is called public wrath the national guards of the suburbs rushed up in haste and disorder a battalion of the 12th light came at a run from saint denis the 14th of the line arrived from courbevoie the batteries of the military school had taken up their position on the carrousel cannons were descending from vincennes solitude was formed around the tuileries louis philippe was perfectly serene chapter v originality of paris during the last two years as we have said paris had witnessed more than one insurrection nothing is generally more singularly calm than the physiognomy of paris during an uprising beyond the bounds of the rebellious quarters paris very speedily accustoms herself to anything it is only a riot and paris has so many affairs on hand that she does not put herself out for so small a matter these colossal cities alone can offer such spectacles these immense enclosures alone can contain at the same time civil war and an odd and indescribable tranquillity ordinarily when an insurrection commences when the shop keeper hears the drum the call to arms the general alarm he contents himself with the remark there appears to be a squabble in the rue saint martin or in the faubourg saint antoine often he adds carelessly or somewhere in that direction later on when the heart rending and mournful hubbub of musketry and firing by platoons becomes audible the shopkeeper says it s getting hot hullo it s getting hot a moment later the riot approaches and gains in force he shuts up his shop precipitately hastily dons his uniform that is to say he places his merchandise in safety and risks his own person men fire in a square in a passage in a blind alley they take and re take the barricade blood flows the grape shot riddles the fronts of the houses the balls kill people in their beds corpses encumber the streets a few streets away the shock of billiard balls can be heard in the cafés the theatres open their doors and present vaudevilles the curious laugh and chat a couple of paces distant from these streets filled with war hackney carriages go their way passers by are going to a dinner somewhere in town sometimes in the very quarter where the fighting is going on in 1831 a fusillade was stopped to allow a wedding party to pass at the time of the insurrection of 1839 in the rue saint martin a little infirm old man pushing a hand cart surmounted by a tricolored rag in which he had carafes filled with some sort of liquid went and came from barricade to troops and from troops to the barricade offering his glasses of cocoa impartially now to the government now to anarchy nothing can be stranger and this is the peculiar character of uprisings in paris which cannot be found in any other capital to this end two things are requisite the size of paris and its gayety the city of voltaire and napoleon is necessary on this occasion however in the resort to arms of june 25th 1832 the great city felt something which was perhaps stronger than itself it was afraid closed doors windows and shutters were to be seen everywhere in the most distant and most disinterested quarters the courageous took to arms the poltroons hid the busy and heedless passer by disappeared many streets were empty at four o clock in the morning alarming details were hawked about fatal news was disseminated that they were masters of the bank that there were six hundred of them in the cloister of saint merry alone entrenched and embattled in the church that the line was not to be depended on that armand carrel had been to see marshal clausel and that the marshal had said get a regiment first that lafayette was ill but that he had said to them nevertheless i am with you i will follow you wherever there is room for a chair that one must be on one s guard that at night there would be people pillaging isolated dwellings in the deserted corners of paris there the imagination of the police that anne radcliffe mixed up with the government was recognizable that a battery had been established in the rue aubry le boucher that lobau and bugeaud were putting their heads together and that at midnight or at daybreak at latest four columns would march simultaneously on the centre of the uprising the first coming from the bastille the second from the porte saint martin the third from the grève the fourth from the halles that perhaps also the troops would evacuate paris and withdraw to the champ de mars that no one knew what would happen but that this time it certainly was serious people busied themselves over marshal soult s hesitations why did not he attack at once it is certain that he was profoundly absorbed the old lion seemed to scent an unknown monster in that gloom evening came the theatres did not open the patrols circulated with an air of irritation passers by were searched suspicious persons were arrested by nine o clock more than eight hundred persons had been arrested the prefecture of police was encumbered with them so was the conciergerie so was la force at the conciergerie in particular the long vault which is called the rue de paris was littered with trusses of straw upon which lay a heap of prisoners whom the man of lyons lagrange harangued valiantly all that straw rustled by all these men produced the sound of a heavy shower elsewhere prisoners slept in the open air in the meadows piled on top of each other anxiety reigned everywhere and a certain tremor which was not habitual with paris people barricaded themselves in their houses wives and mothers were uneasy nothing was to be heard but this ah my god he has not come home there was hardly even the distant rumble of a vehicle to be heard people listened on their thresholds to the rumors the shouts the tumult the dull and indistinct sounds to the things that were said it is cavalry or those are the caissons galloping to the trumpets the drums the firing and above all to that lamentable alarm peal from saint merry they waited for the first cannon shot men sprang up at the corners of the streets and disappeared shouting go home and people made haste to bolt their doors they said how will all this end from moment to moment in proportion as the darkness descended paris seemed to take on a more mournful hue from the formidable flaming of the revolt book eleventh the atom fraternizes with the hurricane chapter i some explanations with regard to the origin of gavroche s poetry the influence of an academician on this poetry at the instant when the insurrection arising from the shock of the populace and the military in front of the arsenal started a movement in advance and towards the rear in the multitude which was following the hearse and which through the whole length of the boulevards weighed so to speak on the head of the procession there arose a frightful ebb the rout was shaken their ranks were broken all ran fled made their escape some with shouts of attack others with the pallor of flight the great river which covered the boulevards divided in a twinkling overflowed to right and left and spread in torrents over two hundred streets at once with the roar of a sewer that has broken loose at that moment a ragged child who was coming down through the rue ménilmontant holding in his hand a branch of blossoming laburnum which he had just plucked on the heights of belleville caught sight of an old holster pistol in the show window of a bric à brac merchant s shop mother what s your name i m going to borrow your machine and off he ran with the pistol two minutes later a flood of frightened bourgeois who were fleeing through the rue amelot and the rue basse encountered the lad brandishing his pistol and singing la nuit on ne voit rien le jour on voit très bien d un écrit apocryphe le bourgeois s ébouriffe pratiquez la vertu tutu chapeau pointu a href linknote 44 name linknoteref 44 id linknoteref 44 44 a it was little gavroche on his way to the wars on the boulevard he noticed that the pistol had no trigger who was the author of that couplet which served to punctuate his march and of all the other songs which he was fond of singing on occasion we know not who does know himself perhaps however gavroche was well up in all the popular tunes in circulation and he mingled with them his own chirpings an observing urchin and a rogue he made a potpourri of the voices of nature and the voices of paris he combined the repertory of the birds with the repertory of the workshops he was acquainted with thieves a tribe contiguous to his own he had it appears been for three months apprenticed to a printer he had one day executed a commission for m baour lormian one of the forty gavroche was a gamin of letters moreover gavroche had no suspicion of the fact that when he had offered the hospitality of his elephant to two brats on that villainously rainy night it was to his own brothers that he had played the part of providence his brothers in the evening his father in the morning that is what his night had been like on quitting the rue des ballets at daybreak he had returned in haste to the elephant had artistically extracted from it the two brats had shared with them some sort of breakfast which he had invented and had then gone away confiding them to that good mother the street who had brought him up almost entirely on leaving them he had appointed to meet them at the same spot in the evening and had left them this discourse by way of a farewell i break a cane otherwise expressed i cut my stick or as they say at the court i file off if you don t find papa and mamma young uns come back here this evening i ll scramble you up some supper and i ll give you a shakedown the two children picked up by some policeman and placed in the refuge or stolen by some mountebank or having simply strayed off in that immense chinese puzzle of a paris did not return the lowest depths of the actual social world are full of these lost traces gavroche did not see them again ten or twelve weeks had elapsed since that night more than once he had scratched the back of his head and said where the devil are my two children in the meantime he had arrived pistol in hand in the rue du pont aux choux he noticed that there was but one shop open in that street and a matter worthy of reflection that was a pastry cook s shop this presented a providential occasion to eat another apple turnover before entering the unknown gavroche halted fumbled in his fob turned his pocket inside out found nothing not even a sou and began to shout help it is hard to miss the last cake nevertheless gavroche pursued his way two minutes later he was in the rue saint louis while traversing the rue du parc royal he felt called upon to make good the loss of the apple turnover which had been impossible and he indulged himself in the immense delight of tearing down the theatre posters in broad daylight a little further on on catching sight of a group of comfortable looking persons who seemed to be landed proprietors he shrugged his shoulders and spit out at random before him this mouthful of philosophical bile as they passed how fat those moneyed men are they re drunk they just wallow in good dinners ask em what they do with their money they don t know they eat it that s what they do as much as their bellies will hold chapter ii gavroche on the march the brandishing of a triggerless pistol grasped in one s hand in the open street is so much of a public function that gavroche felt his fervor increasing with every moment amid the scraps of the marseillaise which he was singing he shouted all goes well i suffer a great deal in my left paw i m all broken up with rheumatism but i m satisfied citizens all that the bourgeois have to do is to bear themselves well i ll sneeze them out subversive couplets what are the police spies dogs and i d just like to have one of them at the end of my pistol i m just from the boulevard my friends it s getting hot there it s getting into a little boil it s simmering it s time to skim the pot forward march men let an impure blood inundate the furrows i give my days to my country i shall never see my concubine more nini finished yes nini but never mind long live joy let s fight crebleu i ve had enough of despotism at that moment the horse of a lancer of the national guard having fallen gavroche laid his pistol on the pavement and picked up the man then he assisted in raising the horse after which he picked up his pistol and resumed his way in the rue de thorigny all was peace and silence this apathy peculiar to the marais presented a contrast with the vast surrounding uproar four gossips were chatting in a doorway scotland has trios of witches paris has quartettes of old gossiping hags and the thou shalt be king could be quite as mournfully hurled at bonaparte in the carrefour baudoyer as at macbeth on the heath of armuyr the croak would be almost identical the gossips of the rue de thorigny busied themselves only with their own concerns three of them were portresses and the fourth was a rag picker with her basket on her back all four of them seemed to be standing at the four corners of old age which are decrepitude decay ruin and sadness the rag picker was humble in this open air society it is the rag picker who salutes and the portress who patronizes this is caused by the corner for refuse which is fat or lean according to the will of the portresses and after the fancy of the one who makes the heap there may be kindness in the broom this rag picker was a grateful creature and she smiled with what a smile on the three portresses things of this nature were said ah by the way is your cat still cross good gracious cats are naturally the enemies of dogs you know it s the dogs who complain and people also but the fleas from a cat don t go after people that s not the trouble dogs are dangerous i remember one year when there were so many dogs that it was necessary to put it in the newspapers that was at the time when there were at the tuileries great sheep that drew the little carriage of the king of rome do you remember the king of rome i liked the duc de bordeau better i knew louis xviii i prefer louis xviii meat is awfully dear isn t it mother patagon ah don t mention it the butcher s shop is a horror a horrible horror one can t afford anything but the poor cuts nowadays here the rag picker interposed ladies business is dull the refuse heaps are miserable no one throws anything away any more they eat everything there are poorer people than you la vargoulême ah that s true replied the rag picker with deference i have a profession a pause succeeded and the rag picker yielding to that necessity for boasting which lies at the bottom of man added in the morning on my return home i pick over my basket i sort my things this makes heaps in my room i put the rags in a basket the cores and stalks in a bucket the linen in my cupboard the woollen stuff in my commode the old papers in the corner of the window the things that are good to eat in my bowl the bits of glass in my fireplace the old shoes behind my door and the bones under my bed gavroche had stopped behind her and was listening old ladies said he what do you mean by talking politics he was assailed by a broadside composed of a quadruple howl here s another rascal what s that he s got in his paddle a pistol well i d like to know what sort of a beggar s brat this is that sort of animal is never easy unless he s overturning the authorities gavroche disdainfully contented himself by way of reprisal with elevating the tip of his nose with his thumb and opening his hand wide the rag picker cried you malicious bare pawed little wretch the one who answered to the name of patagon clapped her hands together in horror there s going to be evil doings that s certain the errand boy next door has a little pointed beard i have seen him pass every day with a young person in a pink bonnet on his arm to day i saw him pass and he had a gun on his arm mame bacheux says that last week there was a revolution at at at where s the calf at pontoise and then there you see him that horrid scamp with his pistol it seems that the célestins are full of pistols what do you suppose the government can do with good for nothings who don t know how to do anything but contrive ways of upsetting the world when we had just begun to get a little quiet after all the misfortunes that have happened good lord to that poor queen whom i saw pass in the tumbril and all this is going to make tobacco dearer it s infamous and i shall certainly go to see him beheaded on the guillotine the wretch you ve got the sniffles old lady said gavroche blow your promontory and he passed on when he was in the rue pavée the rag picker occurred to his mind and he indulged in this soliloquy you re in the wrong to insult the revolutionists mother dust heap corner this pistol is in your interests it s so that you may have more good things to eat in your basket all at once he heard a shout behind him it was the portress patagon who had followed him and who was shaking her fist at him in the distance and crying you re nothing but a bastard oh come now said gavroche i don t care a brass farthing for that shortly afterwards he passed the hotel lamoignon there he uttered this appeal forward march to the battle and he was seized with a fit of melancholy he gazed at his pistol with an air of reproach which seemed an attempt to appease it i m going off said he but you won t go off one dog may distract the attention from another dog 45 a very gaunt poodle came along at the moment gavroche felt compassion for him my poor doggy said he you must have gone and swallowed a cask for all the hoops are visible then he directed his course towards l orme saint gervais chapter iii just indignation of a hair dresser the worthy hair dresser who had chased from his shop the two little fellows to whom gavroche had opened the paternal interior of the elephant was at that moment in his shop engaged in shaving an old soldier of the legion who had served under the empire they were talking the hair dresser had naturally spoken to the veteran of the riot then of general lamarque and from lamarque they had passed to the emperor thence sprang up a conversation between barber and soldier which prudhomme had he been present would have enriched with arabesques and which he would have entitled dialogue between the razor and the sword how did the emperor ride sir said the barber badly he did not know how to fall so he never fell did he have fine horses he must have had fine horses on the day when he gave me my cross i noticed his beast it was a racing mare perfectly white her ears were very wide apart her saddle deep a fine head marked with a black star a very long neck strongly articulated knees prominent ribs oblique shoulders and a powerful crupper a little more than fifteen hands in height a pretty horse remarked the hair dresser it was his majesty s beast the hair dresser felt that after this observation a short silence would be fitting so he conformed himself to it and then went on the emperor was never wounded but once was he sir the old soldier replied with the calm and sovereign tone of a man who had been there in the heel at ratisbon i never saw him so well dressed as on that day he was as neat as a new sou and you mr veteran you must have been often wounded i said the soldier ah not to amount to anything at marengo i received two sabre blows on the back of my neck a bullet in the right arm at austerlitz another in the left hip at jena at friedland a thrust from a bayonet there at the moskowa seven or eight lance thrusts no matter where at lutzen a splinter of a shell crushed one of my fingers ah and then at waterloo a ball from a biscaïen in the thigh that s all how fine that is exclaimed the hair dresser in pindaric accents to die on the field of battle on my word of honor rather than die in bed of an illness slowly a bit by bit each day with drugs cataplasms syringes medicines i should prefer to receive a cannon ball in my belly you re not over fastidious said the soldier he had hardly spoken when a fearful crash shook the shop the show window had suddenly been fractured the wig maker turned pale ah good god he exclaimed it s one of them what a cannon ball here it is said the soldier and he picked up something that was rolling about the floor it was a pebble the hair dresser ran to the broken window and beheld gavroche fleeing at the full speed towards the marché saint jean as he passed the hair dresser s shop gavroche who had the two brats still in his mind had not been able to resist the impulse to say good day to him and had flung a stone through his panes you see shrieked the hair dresser who from white had turned blue that fellow returns and does mischief for the pure pleasure of it what has any one done to that gamin chapter iv the child is amazed at the old man in the meantime in the marché saint jean where the post had already been disarmed gavroche had just effected a junction with a band led by enjolras courfeyrac combeferre and feuilly they were armed after a fashion bahorel and jean prouvaire had found them and swelled the group enjolras had a double barrelled hunting gun combeferre the gun of a national guard bearing the number of his legion and in his belt two pistols which his unbuttoned coat allowed to be seen jean prouvaire an old cavalry musket bahorel a rifle courfeyrac was brandishing an unsheathed sword cane feuilly with a naked sword in his hand marched at their head shouting long live poland they reached the quai morland cravatless hatless breathless soaked by the rain with lightning in their eyes gavroche accosted them calmly where are we going come along said courfeyrac behind feuilly marched or rather bounded bahorel who was like a fish in water in a riot he wore a scarlet waistcoat and indulged in the sort of words which break everything his waistcoat astounded a passer by who cried in bewilderment here are the reds the reds the reds retorted bahorel a queer kind of fear bourgeois for my part i don t tremble before a poppy the little red hat inspires me with no alarm take my advice bourgeois let s leave fear of the red to horned cattle he caught sight of a corner of the wall on which was placarded the most peaceable sheet of paper in the world a permission to eat eggs a lenten admonition addressed by the archbishop of paris to his flock bahorel exclaimed flock a polite way of saying geese and he tore the charge from the nail this conquered gavroche from that instant gavroche set himself to study bahorel bahorel observed enjolras you are wrong you should have let that charge alone he is not the person with whom we have to deal you are wasting your wrath to no purpose take care of your supply one does not fire out of the ranks with the soul any more than with a gun each one in his own fashion enjolras retorted bahorel this bishop s prose shocks me i want to eat eggs without being permitted your style is the hot and cold i am amusing myself besides i m not wasting myself i m getting a start and if i tore down that charge hercle twas only to whet my appetite this word hercle struck gavroche he sought all occasions for learning and that tearer down of posters possessed his esteem he inquired of him what does hercle mean bahorel answered it means cursed name of a dog in latin here bahorel recognized at a window a pale young man with a black beard who was watching them as they passed probably a friend of the a b c he shouted to him quick cartridges para bellum a fine man that s true said gavroche who now understood latin a tumultuous retinue accompanied them students artists young men affiliated to the cougourde of aix artisans longshoremen armed with clubs and bayonets some like combeferre with pistols thrust into their trousers an old man who appeared to be extremely aged was walking in the band he had no arms and he made great haste so that he might not be left behind although he had a thoughtful air gavroche caught sight of him keksekça said he to courfeyrac he s an old duffer it was m mabeuf chapter v the old man let us recount what had taken place enjolras and his friends had been on the boulevard bourdon near the public storehouses at the moment when the dragoons had made their charge enjolras courfeyrac and combeferre were among those who had taken to the rue bassompierre shouting to the barricades in the rue lesdiguières they had met an old man walking along what had attracted their attention was that the goodman was walking in a zig zag as though he were intoxicated moreover he had his hat in his hand although it had been raining all the morning and was raining pretty briskly at the very time courfeyrac had recognized father mabeuf he knew him through having many times accompanied marius as far as his door as he was acquainted with the peaceful and more than timid habits of the old beadle book collector and was amazed at the sight of him in the midst of that uproar a couple of paces from the cavalry charges almost in the midst of a fusillade hatless in the rain and strolling about among the bullets he had accosted him and the following dialogue had been exchanged between the rioter of fire and the octogenarian m mabeuf go to your home why there s going to be a row that s well thrusts with the sword and firing m mabeuf that is well firing from cannon that is good where are the rest of you going we are going to fling the government to the earth that is good and he had set out to follow them from that moment forth he had not uttered a word his step had suddenly become firm artisans had offered him their arms he had refused with a sign of the head he advanced nearly to the front rank of the column with the movement of a man who is marching and the countenance of a man who is sleeping what a fierce old fellow muttered the students the rumor spread through the troop that he was a former member of the convention an old regicide the mob had turned in through the rue de la verrerie little gavroche marched in front with that deafening song which made of him a sort of trumpet he sang voici la lune qui paraît quand irons nous dans la forêt demandait charlot à charlotte tou tou tou pour chatou je n

was turning gray and whose bold and daring mien was remarked by courfeyrac enjolras and combeferre but whom none of them knew joined them gavroche who was occupied in singing whistling humming running on ahead and pounding on the shutters of the shops with the butt of his triggerless pistol paid no attention to this man it chanced that in the rue de la verrerie they passed in front of courfeyrac s door this happens just right said courfeyrac i have forgotten my purse and i have lost my hat he quitted the mob and ran up to his quarters at full speed he seized an old hat and his purse he also seized a large square coffer of the dimensions of a large valise which was concealed under his soiled linen as he descended again at a run the portress hailed him monsieur de courfeyrac what s your name portress the portress stood bewildered why you know perfectly well i m the concierge my name is mother veuvain well if you call me monsieur de courfeyrac again i shall call you mother de veuvain now speak what s the matter what do you want there is some one who wants to speak with you who is it i don t know where is he in my lodge the devil ejaculated courfeyrac but the person has been waiting your return for over an hour said the portress at the same time a sort of pale thin small freckled and youthful artisan clad in a tattered blouse and patched trousers of ribbed velvet and who had rather the air of a girl accoutred as a man than of a man emerged from the lodge and said to courfeyrac in a voice which was not the least in the world like a woman s voice monsieur marius if you please he is not here will he return this evening i know nothing about it and courfeyrac added for my part i shall not return the young man gazed steadily at him and said why not because where are you going then what business is that of yours would you like to have me carry your coffer for you i am going to the barricades would you like to have me go with you if you like replied courfeyrac the street is free the pavements belong to every one and he made his escape at a run to join his friends when he had rejoined them he gave the coffer to one of them to carry it was only a quarter of an hour after this that he saw the young man who had actually followed them a mob does not go precisely where it intends we have explained that a gust of wind carries it away they overshot saint merry and found themselves without precisely knowing how in the rue saint denis book twelfth corinthe chapter i history of corinthe from its foundation the parisians who nowadays on entering on the rue rambuteau at the end near the halles notice on their right opposite the rue mondétour a basket maker s shop having for its sign a basket in the form of napoleon the great with this inscription napoleon is made wholly of willow have no suspicion of the terrible scenes which this very spot witnessed hardly thirty years ago it was there that lay the rue de la chanvrerie which ancient deeds spell chanverrerie and the celebrated public house called corinthe the reader will remember all that has been said about the barricade effected at this point and eclipsed by the way by the barricade saint merry it was on this famous barricade of the rue de la chanvrerie now fallen into profound obscurity that we are about to shed a little light may we be permitted to recur for the sake of clearness in the recital to the simple means which we have already employed in the case of waterloo persons who wish to picture to themselves in a tolerably exact manner the constitution of the houses which stood at that epoch near the pointe saint eustache at the northeast angle of the halles of paris where to day lies the embouchure of the rue rambuteau have only to imagine an n touching the rue saint denis with its summit and the halles with its base and whose two vertical bars should form the rue de la grande truanderie and the rue de la chanvrerie and whose transverse bar should be formed by the rue de la petite truanderie the old rue mondétour cut the three strokes of the n at the most crooked angles so that the labyrinthine confusion of these four streets sufficed to form on a space three fathoms square between the halles and the rue saint denis on the one hand and between the rue du cygne and the rue des prêcheurs on the other seven islands of houses oddly cut up of varying sizes placed crosswise and hap hazard and barely separated like the blocks of stone in a dock by narrow crannies we say narrow crannies and we can give no more just idea of those dark contracted many angled alleys lined with eight story buildings these buildings were so decrepit that in the rue de la chanvrerie and the rue de la petite truanderie the fronts were shored up with beams running from one house to another the street was narrow and the gutter broad the pedestrian there walked on a pavement that was always wet skirting little stalls resembling cellars big posts encircled with iron hoops excessive heaps of refuse and gates armed with enormous century old gratings the rue rambuteau has devastated all that the name of mondétour paints marvellously well the sinuosities of that whole set of streets a little further on they are found still better expressed by the rue pirouette which ran into the rue mondétour the passer by who got entangled from the rue saint denis in the rue de la chanvrerie beheld it gradually close in before him as though he had entered an elongated funnel at the end of this street which was very short he found further passage barred in the direction of the halles by a tall row of houses and he would have thought himself in a blind alley had he not perceived on the right and left two dark cuts through which he could make his escape this was the rue mondétour which on one side ran into the rue de prêcheurs and on the other into the rue du cygne and the petite truanderie at the bottom of this sort of cul de sac at the angle of the cutting on the right there was to be seen a house which was not so tall as the rest and which formed a sort of cape in the street it is in this house of two stories only that an illustrious wine shop had been merrily installed three hundred years before this tavern created a joyous noise in the very spot which old theophilus described in the following couplet là branle le squelette horrible d un pauvre amant qui se pendit a href linknote 47 name linknoteref 47 id linknoteref 47 47 a the situation was good and tavern keepers succeeded each other there from father to son in the time of mathurin regnier this cabaret was called the pot aux roses and as the rebus was then in fashion it had for its sign board a post poteau painted rose color in the last century the worthy natoire one of the fantastic masters nowadays despised by the stiff school having got drunk many times in this wine shop at the very table where regnier had drunk his fill had painted by way of gratitude a bunch of corinth grapes on the pink post the keeper of the cabaret in his joy had changed his device and had caused to be placed in gilt letters beneath the bunch these words at the bunch of corinth grapes au raisin de corinthe hence the name of corinthe nothing is more natural to drunken men than ellipses the ellipsis is the zig zag of the phrase corinthe gradually dethroned the pot aux roses the last proprietor of the dynasty father hucheloup no longer acquainted even with the tradition had the post painted blue a room on the ground floor where the bar was situated one on the first floor containing a billiard table a wooden spiral staircase piercing the ceiling wine on the tables smoke on the walls candles in broad daylight this was the style of this cabaret a staircase with a trap door in the lower room led to the cellar on the second floor were the lodgings of the hucheloup family they were reached by a staircase which was a ladder rather than a staircase and had for their entrance only a private door in the large room on the first floor under the roof in two mansard attics were the nests for the servants the kitchen shared the ground floor with the tap room father hucheloup had possibly been born a chemist but the fact is that he was a cook people did not confine themselves to drinking alone in his wine shop they also ate there hucheloup had invented a capital thing which could be eaten nowhere but in his house stuffed carps which he called carpes au gras these were eaten by the light of a tallow candle or of a lamp of the time of louis xvi on tables to which were nailed waxed cloths in lieu of table cloths people came thither from a distance hucheloup one fine morning had seen fit to notify passers by of this specialty he had dipped a brush in a pot of black paint and as he was an orthographer on his own account as well as a cook after his own fashion he had improvised on his wall this remarkable inscription carpes ho gras one winter the rain storms and the showers had taken a fancy to obliterate the s which terminated the first word and the g which began the third this is what remained carpe ho ras time and rain assisting a humble gastronomical announcement had become a profound piece of advice in this way it came about that though he knew no french father hucheloup understood latin that he had evoked philosophy from his kitchen and that desirous simply of effacing lent he had equalled horace and the striking thing about it was that that also meant enter my wine shop nothing of all this is in existence now the mondétour labyrinth was disembowelled and widely opened in 1847 and probably no longer exists at the present moment the rue de la chanvrerie and corinthe have disappeared beneath the pavement of the rue rambuteau as we have already said corinthe was the meeting place if not the rallying point of courfeyrac and his friends it was grantaire who had discovered corinthe he had entered it on account of the carpe horas and had returned thither on account of the carpes au gras there they drank there they ate there they shouted they did not pay much they paid badly they did not pay at all but they were always welcome father hucheloup was a jovial host hucheloup that amiable man as was just said was a wine shop keeper with a mustache an amusing variety he always had an ill tempered air seemed to wish to intimidate his customers grumbled at the people who entered his establishment and had rather the mien of seeking a quarrel with them than of serving them with soup and yet we insist upon the word people were always welcome there this oddity had attracted customers to his shop and brought him young men who said to each other come hear father hucheloup growl he had been a fencing master all of a sudden he would burst out laughing a big voice a good fellow he had a comic foundation under a tragic exterior he asked nothing better than to frighten you very much like those snuff boxes which are in the shape of a pistol the detonation makes one sneeze mother hucheloup his wife was a bearded and a very homely creature about 1830 father hucheloup died with him disappeared the secret of stuffed carps his inconsolable widow continued to keep the wine shop but the cooking deteriorated and became execrable the wine which had always been bad became fearfully bad nevertheless courfeyrac and his friends continued to go to corinthe out of pity as bossuet said the widow hucheloup was breathless and misshapen and given to rustic recollections she deprived them of their flatness by her pronunciation she had a way of her own of saying things which spiced her reminiscences of the village and of her springtime it had formerly been her delight so she affirmed to hear the loups de gorge rouges gorges chanter dans les ogrepines aubépines to hear the redbreasts sing in the hawthorn trees the hall on the first floor where the restaurant was situated was a large and long apartment encumbered with stools chairs benches and tables and with a crippled lame old billiard table it was reached by a spiral staircase which terminated in the corner of the room at a square hole like the hatchway of a ship this room lighted by a single narrow window and by a lamp that was always burning had the air of a garret all the four footed furniture comported itself as though it had but three legs the whitewashed walls had for their only ornament the following quatrain in honor of mame hucheloup elle étonne à dix pas elle épouvente à deux une verrue habite en son nez hasardeux on tremble à

hucheloup a good likeness went and came from morning till night before this quatrain with the most perfect tranquillity two serving maids named matelote and gibelotte 49 and who had never been known by any other names helped mame hucheloup to set on the tables the jugs of poor wine and the various broths which were served to the hungry patrons in earthenware bowls matelote large plump redhaired and noisy the favorite ex sultana of the defunct hucheloup was homelier than any mythological monster be it what it may still as it becomes the servant to always keep in the rear of the mistress she was less homely than mame hucheloup gibelotte tall delicate white with a lymphatic pallor with circles round her eyes and drooping lids always languid and weary afflicted with what may be called chronic lassitude the first up in the house and the last in bed waited on every one even the other maid silently and gently smiling through her fatigue with a vague and sleepy smile before entering

together slept together they had everything in common even musichetta to some extent they were what the subordinate monks who accompany monks are called bini on the morning of the 5th of june they went to corinthe to breakfast joly who was all stuffed up had a catarrh which laigle was beginning to share laigle s coat was threadbare but joly was well dressed it was about nine o clock in the morning when they opened the door of corinthe they ascended to the first floor matelote and gibelotte received them oysters cheese and ham said laigle and they seated themselves at a table the wine shop was empty there was no one there but themselves gibelotte knowing joly and laigle set a bottle of wine on the table while they were busy with their first oysters a head appeared at the hatchway of the staircase and a voice said i am passing by i smell from the street a delicious odor of brie cheese i enter it was grantaire grantaire took a stool and drew up to the table at the sight of grantaire gibelotte placed two bottles of wine on the table that made three are you going to drink those two bottles laigle inquired of grantaire grantaire replied all are ingenious thou alone art ingenuous two bottles never yet astonished a man the others had begun by eating grantaire began by drinking half a bottle was rapidly gulped down so you have a hole in your stomach began laigle again you have one in your elbow said grantaire and after having emptied his glass he added ah by the way laigle of the funeral oration your coat is old i should hope so retorted laigle that s why we get on well together my coat and i it has acquired all my folds it does not bind me anywhere it is moulded on my deformities it falls in with all my movements i am only conscious of it because it keeps me warm old coats are just like old friends that s true ejaculated joly striking into the dialogue an old goat is an old abi ami friend especially in the mouth of a man whose head is stuffed up said grantaire grantaire demanded laigle have you just come from the boulevard no we have just seen the head of the procession pass joly and i it s a marvellous sight said joly how quiet this street is exclaimed laigle who would suspect that paris was turned upside down how plainly it is to be seen that in former days there were nothing but convents here in this neighborhood du breul and sauval give a list of them and so does the abbé lebeuf they were all round here they fairly swarmed booted and barefooted shaven bearded gray black white franciscans minims capuchins carmelites little augustines great augustines old augustines there was no end of them don t let s talk of monks interrupted grantaire it makes one want to scratch one s self then he exclaimed bouh i ve just swallowed a bad oyster now hypochondria is taking possession of me again the oysters are spoiled the servants are ugly i hate the human race i just passed through the rue richelieu in front of the big public library that pile of oyster shells which is called a library is disgusting even to think of what paper what ink what scrawling and all that has been written what rascal was it who said that man was a featherless biped 51 and then i met a pretty girl of my acquaintance who is as beautiful as the spring worthy to be called floréal and who is delighted enraptured as happy as the angels because a wretch yesterday a frightful banker all spotted with small pox deigned to take a fancy to her alas woman keeps on the watch for a protector as much as for a lover cats chase mice as well as birds two months ago that young woman was virtuous in an attic she adjusted little brass rings in the eyelet holes of corsets what do you call it she sewed she had a camp bed she dwelt beside a pot of flowers she was contented now here she is a bankeress this transformation took place last night i met the victim this morning in high spirits the hideous point about it is that the jade is as pretty to day as she was yesterday her financier did not show in her face roses have this advantage or disadvantage over women that the traces left upon them by caterpillars are visible ah there is no morality on earth i call to witness the myrtle the symbol of love the laurel the symbol of air the olive that ninny the symbol of peace the apple tree which came nearest rangling adam with its pips and the fig tree the grandfather of petticoats as for right do you know what right is the gauls covet clusium rome protects clusium and demands what wrong clusium has done to them brennus answers the wrong that alba did to you the wrong that fidenæ did to you the wrong that the eques the volsci and the sabines have done to you they were your neighbors the clusians are ours we understand neighborliness just as you do you have stolen alba we shall take clusium rome said you shall not take clusium brennus took rome then he cried væ victis that is what right is ah what beasts of prey there are in this world what eagles it makes my flesh creep he held out his glass to joly who filled it then he drank and went on having hardly been interrupted by this glass of wine of which no one not even himself had taken any notice brennus who takes rome is an eagle the banker who takes the grisette is an eagle there is no more modesty in the one case than in the other so we believe in nothing there is but one reality drink whatever your opinion may be in favor of the lean cock like the canton of uri or in favor of the fat cock like the canton of glaris it matters little drink you talk to me of the boulevard of that procession et cætera et cætera come now is there going to be another revolution this poverty of means on the part of the good god astounds me he has to keep greasing the groove of events every moment there is a hitch it won t work quick a revolution the good god has his hands perpetually black with that cart grease if i were in his place i d be perfectly simple about it i would not wind up my mechanism every minute i d lead the human race in a straightforward way i d weave matters mesh by mesh without breaking the thread i would have no provisional arrangements i would have no extraordinary repertory what the rest of you call progress advances by means of two motors men and events but sad to say from time to time the exceptional becomes necessary the ordinary troupe suffices neither for event nor for men among men geniuses are required among events revolutions great accidents are the law the order of things cannot do without them and judging from the apparition of comets one would be tempted to think that heaven itself finds actors needed for its performance at the moment when one expects it the least god placards a meteor on the wall of the firmament some queer star turns up underlined by an enormous tail and that causes the death of cæsar brutus deals him a blow with a knife and god a blow with a comet crac and behold an aurora borealis behold a revolution behold a great man 93 in big letters napoleon on guard the comet of 1811 at the head of the poster ah what a beautiful blue theatre all studded with unexpected flashes boum boum extraordinary show raise your eyes boobies everything is in disorder the star as well as the drama good god it is too much and not enough these resources gathered from exception seem magnificence and poverty my friends providence has come down to expedients what does a revolution prove that god is in a quandry he effects a coup d état because he god has not been able to make both ends meet in fact this confirms me in my conjectures as to jehovah s fortune and when i see so much distress in heaven and on earth from the bird who has not a grain of millet to myself without a hundred thousand livres of income when i see human destiny which is very badly worn and even royal destiny which is threadbare witness the prince de condé hung when i see winter which is nothing but a rent in the zenith through which the wind blows when i see so many rags even in the perfectly new purple of the morning on the crests of hills when i see the drops of dew those mock pearls when i see the frost that paste when i see humanity ripped apart and events patched up and so many spots on the sun and so many holes in the moon when i see so much misery everywhere i suspect that god is not rich the appearance exists it is true but i feel that he is hard up he gives a revolution as a tradesman whose money box is empty gives a ball god must not be judged from appearances beneath the gilding of heaven i perceive a poverty stricken universe creation is bankrupt that is why i am discontented here it is the 4th of june it is almost night ever since this morning i have been waiting for daylight to come it has not come and i bet that it won t come all day this is the inexactness of an ill paid clerk yes everything is badly arranged nothing fits anything else this old world is all warped i take my stand on the opposition everything goes awry the universe is a tease it s like children those who want them have none and those who don t want them have them total i m vexed besides laigle de meaux that bald head offends my sight it humiliates me to think that i am of the same age as that baldy however i criticise but i do not insult the universe is what it is i speak here without evil intent and to ease my conscience receive eternal father the assurance of my distinguished consideration ah by all the saints of olympus and by all the gods of paradise i was not intended to be a parisian that is to say to rebound forever like a shuttlecock between two battledores from the group of the loungers to the group of the roysterers i was made to be a turk watching oriental houris all day long executing those exquisite egyptian dances as sensuous as the dream of a chaste man or a beauceron peasant or a venetian gentleman surrounded by gentlewoman or a petty german prince furnishing the half of a foot soldier to the germanic confederation and occupying his leisure with drying his breeches on his hedge that is to say his frontier those are the positions for which i was born yes i have said a turk and i will not retract i do not understand how people can habitually take turks in bad part mohammed had his good points respect for the inventor of seraglios with houris and paradises with odalisques let us not insult mohammedanism the only religion which is ornamented with a hen roost now i insist on a drink the earth is a great piece of stupidity and it appears that they are going to fight all those imbeciles and to break each other s profiles and to massacre each other in the heart of summer in the month of june when they might go off with a creature on their arm to breathe the immense heaps of new mown hay in the meadows really people do commit altogether too many follies an old broken lantern which i have just seen at a bric à brac merchant s suggests a reflection to my mind it is time to enlighten the human race yes behold me sad again that s what comes of swallowing an oyster and a revolution the wrong way i am growing melancholy once more oh frightful old world people strive turn each other out prostitute themselves kill each other and get used to it and grantaire after this fit of eloquence had a fit of coughing which was well earned à propos of revolution said joly it is decidedly abberent that barius is in lub does any one know with whom demanded laigle do no do i tell you marius love affairs exclaimed grantaire i can imagine it marius is a fog and he must have found a vapor marius is of the race of poets he who says poet says fool madman tymbræus apollo marius and his marie or his marion or his maria or his mariette they must make a queer pair of lovers i know just what it is like ecstasies in which they forget to kiss pure on earth but joined in heaven they are souls possessed of senses they lie among the stars grantaire was attacking his second bottle and possibly his second harangue when a new personage emerged from the square aperture of the stairs it was a boy less than ten years of age ragged very small yellow with an odd phiz a vivacious eye an enormous amount of hair drenched with rain and wearing a contented air the child unhesitatingly making his choice among the three addressed himself to laigle de meaux are you monsieur bossuet that is my nickname replied laigle what do you want with me this a tall blonde fellow on the boulevard said to me do you know mother hucheloup i said yes rue chanvrerie the old man s widow he said to me go there there you will find m bossuet tell him from me a b c it s a joke that they re playing on you isn t it he gave me ten sous joly lend me ten sous said laigle and turning to grantaire grantaire lend me ten sous this made twenty sous which laigle handed to the lad thank you sir said the urchin what is your name inquired laigle navet gavroche s friend stay with us said laigle breakfast with us said grantaire the child replied i can t i belong in the procession i m the one to shout down with polignac and executing a prolonged scrape of his foot behind him which is the most respectful of all possible salutes he took his departure the child gone grantaire took the word that is the pure bred gamin there are a great many varieties of the gamin species the notary s gamin is called skip the gutter the cook s gamin is called a scullion the baker s gamin is called a mitron the lackey s gamin is called a groom the marine gamin is called the cabin boy the soldier s gamin is called the drummer boy the painter s gamin is called paint grinder the tradesman s gamin is called an errand boy the courtesan gamin is called the minion the kingly gamin is called the dauphin the god gamin is called the bambino in the meantime laigle was engaged in reflection he said half aloud a b c that is to say the burial of lamarque the tall blonde remarked grantaire is enjolras who is sending you a warning shall we go ejaculated bossuet it s raiding said joly i have sworn to go through fire but not through water i don t wand to ged a gold i shall stay here said grantaire i prefer a breakfast to a hearse conclusion we remain said laigle well then let us drink besides we might miss the funeral without missing the riot ah the riot i am with you cried joly laigle rubbed his hands now we re going to touch up the revolution of 1830 as a matter of fact it does hurt the people along the seams i don t think much of your revolution said grantaire i don t execrate this government it is the crown tempered by the cotton night cap it is a sceptre ending in an umbrella in fact i think that to day with the present weather louis philippe might utilize his royalty in two directions he might extend the tip of the sceptre end against the people and open the umbrella end against heaven the room was dark large clouds had just finished the extinction of daylight there was no one in the wine shop or in the street every one having gone off to watch events is it mid day or midnight cried bossuet you can t see your hand before your face gibelotte fetch a light grantaire was drinking in a melancholy way enjolras disdains me he muttered enjolras said joly is ill grantaire is drunk it was to bossuet that he sent navet if he had come for me i would have followed him so much the worse for enjolras i won t go to his funeral this resolution once arrived at bossuet joly and grantaire did not stir from the wine shop by two o clock in the afternoon the table at which they sat was covered with empty bottles two candles were burning on it one in a flat copper candlestick which was perfectly green the other in the neck of a cracked carafe grantaire had seduced joly and bossuet to wine bossuet and joly had conducted grantaire back towards cheerfulness as for grantaire he had got beyond wine that merely moderate inspirer of dreams ever since mid day wine enjoys only a conventional popularity with serious drinkers there is in fact in the matter of inebriety white magic and black magic wine is only white magic grantaire was a daring drinker of dreams the blackness of a terrible fit of drunkenness yawning before him far from arresting him attracted him he had abandoned the bottle and taken to the beerglass the beer glass is the abyss having neither opium nor hashish on hand and being desirous of filling his brain with twilight he had had recourse to that fearful mixture of brandy stout absinthe which produces the most terrible of lethargies it is of these three vapors beer brandy and absinthe that the lead of the soul is composed they are three grooms the celestial butterfly is drowned in them and there are formed there in a membranous smoke vaguely condensed into the wing of the bat three mute furies nightmare night and death which hover about the slumbering psyche grantaire had not yet reached that lamentable phase far from it he was tremendously gay and bossuet and joly retorted they clinked glasses grantaire added to the eccentric accentuation of words and ideas a peculiarity of gesture he rested his left fist on his knee with dignity his arm forming a right angle and with cravat untied seated astride a stool his full glass in his right hand he hurled solemn words at the big maid servant matelote let the doors of the palace be thrown open let every one be a member of the french academy and have the right to embrace madame hucheloup let us drink and turning to madame hucheloup he added woman ancient and consecrated by use draw near that i may contemplate thee and joly exclaimed matelote and gibelotte dod t gib grantaire anything more to drink he has already devoured since this bording in wild prodigality two francs and ninety five centibes and grantaire began again who has been unhooking the stars without my permission and putting them on the table in the guise of candles bossuet though very drunk preserved his equanimity he was seated on the sill of the open window wetting his back in the falling rain and gazing at his two friends all at once he heard a tumult behind him hurried footsteps cries of to arms he turned round and saw in the rue saint denis at the end of the rue de la chanvrerie enjolras passing gun in hand and gavroche with his pistol feuilly with his sword courfeyrac with his sword and jean prouvaire with his blunderbuss combeferre with his gun bahorel with his gun and the whole armed and stormy rabble which was following them the rue de la chanvrerie was not more than a gunshot long bossuet improvised a speaking trumpet from his two hands placed around his mouth and shouted courfeyrac courfeyrac hohée courfeyrac heard the shout caught sight of bossuet and advanced a few paces into the rue de la chanvrerie shouting what do you want which crossed a where are you going to make a barricade replied courfeyrac well here this is a good place make it here that s true aigle said courfeyrac and at a signal from courfeyrac the mob flung themselves into the rue de la chanvrerie chapter iii night begins to descend upon grantaire the spot was in fact admirably adapted the entrance to the street widened out the other extremity narrowed together into a pocket without exit corinthe created an obstacle the rue mondétour was easily barricaded on the right and the left no attack was possible except from the rue saint denis that is to say in front and in full sight bossuet had the comprehensive glance of a fasting hannibal terror had seized on the whole street at the irruption of the mob there was not a passer by who did not get out of sight in the space of a flash of lightning in the rear to right and left shops stables area doors windows blinds attic skylights shutters of every description were closed from the ground floor to the roof a terrified old woman fixed a mattress in front of her window on two clothes poles for drying linen in order to deaden the effect of musketry the wine shop alone remained open and that for a very good reason that the mob had rushed into it ah my god ah my god sighed mame hucheloup bossuet had gone down to meet courfeyrac joly who had placed himself at the window exclaimed courfeyrac you ought to have brought an umbrella you will gatch gold in the meantime in the space of a few minutes twenty iron bars had been wrenched from the grated front of the wine shop ten fathoms of street had been unpaved gavroche and bahorel had seized in its passage and overturned the dray of a lime dealer named anceau this dray contained three barrels of lime which they placed beneath the piles of paving stones enjolras raised the cellar trap and all the widow hucheloup s empty casks were used to flank the barrels of lime feuilly with his fingers skilled in painting the delicate sticks of fans had backed up the barrels and the dray with two massive heaps of blocks of rough stone blocks which were improvised like the rest and procured no one knows where the beams which served as props were torn from the neighboring house fronts and laid on the casks when bossuet and courfeyrac turned round half the street was already barred with a rampart higher than a man there is nothing like the hand of the populace for building everything that is built by demolishing matelote and gibelotte had mingled with the workers gibelotte went and came loaded with rubbish her lassitude helped on the barricade she served the barricade as she would have served wine with a sleepy air an omnibus with two white horses passed the end of the street bossuet strode over the paving stones ran to it stopped the driver made the passengers alight offered his hand to the ladies dismissed the conductor and returned leading the vehicle and the horses by the bridle omnibuses said he do not pass the corinthe non licet omnibus adire corinthum an instant later the horses were unharnessed and went off at their will through the rue mondétour and the omnibus lying on its side completed the bar across the street mame hucheloup quite upset had taken refuge in the first story her eyes were vague and stared without seeing anything and she cried in a low tone her terrified shrieks did not dare to emerge from her throat the end of the world has come she muttered joly deposited a kiss on mame hucheloup s fat red wrinkled neck and said to grantaire my dear fellow i have always regarded a woman s neck as an infinitely delicate thing but grantaire attained to the highest regions of dithryamb matelote had mounted to the first floor once more grantaire seized her round her waist and gave vent to long bursts of laughter at the window matelote is homely he cried matelote is of a dream of ugliness matelote is a chimæra this is the secret of her birth a gothic pygmalion who was making gargoyles for cathedrals fell in love with one of them the most horrible one fine morning he besought love to give it life and this produced matelote look at her citizens she has chromate of lead colored hair like titian s mistress and she is a good girl i guarantee that she will fight well every good girl contains a hero as for mother hucheloup she s an old warrior look at her moustaches she inherited them from her husband a hussar indeed she will fight too these two alone will strike terror to the heart of the banlieue comrades we shall overthrow the government as true as there are fifteen intermediary acids between margaric acid and formic acid however that is a matter of perfect indifference to me gentlemen my father always detested me because i could not understand mathematics i understand only love and liberty i am grantaire the good fellow having never had any money i never acquired the habit of it and the result is that i have never lacked it but if i had been rich there would have been no more poor people you would have seen oh if the kind hearts only had fat purses how much better things would go i picture myself jesus christ with rothschild s fortune how much good he would do matelote embrace me you are voluptuous and timid you have cheeks which invite the kiss of a sister and lips which claim the kiss of a lover hold your tongue you cask said courfeyrac grantaire retorted i am the capitoul52 and the master of the floral games enjolras who was standing on the crest of the barricade gun in hand raised his beautiful austere face enjolras as the reader knows had something of the spartan and of the puritan in his composition he would have perished at thermopylæ with leonidas and burned at drogheda with cromwell grantaire he shouted go get rid of the fumes of your wine somewhere else than here this is the place for enthusiasm not for drunkenness don t disgrace the barricade this angry speech produced a singular effect on grantaire one would have said that he had had a glass of cold water flung in his face he seemed to be rendered suddenly sober he sat down put his elbows on a table near the window looked at enjolras with indescribable gentleness and said to him let me sleep here go and sleep somewhere else cried enjolras but grantaire still keeping his tender and troubled eyes fixed on him replied let me sleep here until i die enjolras regarded him with disdainful eyes grantaire you are incapable of believing of thinking of willing of living and of dying grantaire replied in a grave tone you will see he stammered a few more unintelligible words then his head fell heavily on the table and as is the usual effect of the second period of inebriety into which enjolras had roughly and abruptly thrust him an instant later he had fallen asleep chapter iv an attempt to console the widow hucheloup bahorel in ecstasies over the barricade shouted here s the street in its low necked dress how well it looks courfeyrac as he demolished the wine shop to some extent sought to console the widowed proprietress mother hucheloup weren t you complaining the other day because you had had a notice served on you for infringing the law because gibelotte shook a counterpane out of your window yes my good monsieur courfeyrac ah good heavens are you going to put that table of mine in your horror too and it was for the counterpane and also for a pot of flowers which fell from the attic window into the street that the government collected a fine of a hundred francs if that isn t an abomination what is well mother hucheloup we are avenging you mother hucheloup did not appear to understand very clearly the benefit which she was to derive from these reprisals made on her account she was satisfied after the manner of that arab woman who having received a box on the ear from her husband went to complain to her father and cried for vengeance saying father you owe my husband affront for affront the father asked on which cheek did you receive the blow on the left cheek the father slapped her right cheek and said now you are satisfied go tell your husband that he boxed my daughter s ears and that i have accordingly boxed his wife s the rain had ceased recruits had arrived workmen had brought under their blouses a barrel of powder a basket containing bottles of vitriol two or three carnival torches and a basket filled with fire pots left over from the king s festival this festival was very recent having taken place on the 1st of may it was said that these munitions came from a grocer in the faubourg saint antoine named pépin they smashed the only street lantern in the rue de la chanvrerie the lantern corresponding to one in the rue saint denis and all the lanterns in the surrounding streets de mondétour du cygne des prêcheurs and de la grande and de la petite truanderie enjolras combeferre and courfeyrac directed everything two barricades were now in process of construction at once both of them resting on the corinthe house and forming a right angle the larger shut off the rue de la chanvrerie the other closed the rue mondétour on the side of the rue de cygne this last barricade which was very narrow was constructed only of casks and paving stones there were about fifty workers on it thirty were armed with guns for on their way they had effected a wholesale loan from an armorer s shop nothing could be more bizarre and at the same time more motley than this troop one had a round jacket a cavalry sabre and two holster pistols another was in his shirt sleeves with a round hat and a powder horn slung at his side a third wore a plastron of nine sheets of gray paper and was armed with a saddler s awl there was one who was shouting let us exterminate them to the last man and die at the point of our bayonet this man had no bayonet another spread out over his coat the cross belt and cartridge box of a national guardsman the cover of the cartridge box being ornamented with this inscription in red worsted public order there were a great many guns bearing the numbers of the legions few hats no cravats many bare arms some pikes add to this all ages all sorts of faces small pale young men and bronzed longshoremen all were in haste and as they helped each other they discussed the possible chances that they would receive succor about three o clock in the morning that they were sure of one regiment that paris would rise terrible sayings with which was mingled a sort of cordial joviality one would have pronounced them brothers but they did not know each other s names great perils have this fine characteristic that they bring to light the fraternity of strangers a fire had been lighted in the kitchen and there they were engaged in moulding into bullets pewter mugs spoons forks and all the brass table ware of the establishment in the midst of it all they drank caps and buckshot were mixed pell mell on the tables with glasses of wine in the billiard hall mame hucheloup matelote and gibelotte variously modified by terror which had stupefied one rendered another breathless and roused the third were tearing up old dish cloths and making lint three insurgents were assisting them three bushy haired jolly blades with beards and moustaches who plucked away at the linen with the fingers of seamstresses and who made them tremble the man of lofty stature whom courfeyrac combeferre and enjolras had observed at the moment when he joined the mob at the corner of the rue des billettes was at work on the smaller barricade and was making himself useful there gavroche was working on the larger one as for the young man who had been waiting for courfeyrac at his lodgings and who had inquired for m marius he had disappeared at about the time when the omnibus had been overturned gavroche completely carried away and radiant had undertaken to get everything in readiness he went came mounted descended re mounted whistled and sparkled he seemed to be there for the encouragement of all had he any incentive yes certainly his poverty had he wings yes certainly his joy gavroche was a whirlwind he was constantly visible he was incessantly audible he filled the air as he was everywhere at once he was a sort of almost irritating ubiquity no halt was possible with him the enormous barricade felt him on its haunches he troubled the loungers he excited the idle he reanimated the weary he grew impatient over the thoughtful he inspired gayety in some and breath in others wrath in others movement in all now pricking a student now biting an artisan he alighted paused flew off again hovered over the tumult and the effort sprang from one party to another murmuring and humming and harassed the whole company a fly on the immense revolutionary coach perpetual motion was in his little arms and perpetual clamor in his little lungs courage more paving stones more casks more machines where are you now a hod of plaster for me to stop this hole with your barricade is very small it must be carried up put everything on it fling everything there stick it all in break down the house a barricade is mother gibou s tea hullo here s a glass door this elicited an exclamation from the workers a glass door what do you expect us to do with a glass door tubercle hercules yourselves retorted gavroche a glass door is an excellent thing in a barricade it does not prevent an attack but it prevents the enemy taking it so you ve never prigged apples over a wall where there were broken bottles a glass door cuts the corns of the national guard when they try to mount on the barricade pardi glass is a treacherous thing well you haven t a very wildly lively imagination comrades however he was furious over his triggerless pistol he went from one to another demanding a gun i want a gun why don t you give me a gun give you a gun said combeferre come now said gavroche why not i had one in 1830 when we had a dispute with charles x enjolras shrugged his shoulders when there are enough for the men we will give some to the children gavroche wheeled round haughtily and answered if you are killed before me i shall take yours gamin said enjolras greenhorn said gavroche a dandy who had lost his way and who lounged past the end of the street created a diversion gavroche shouted to him come with us young fellow well now don t we do anything for this old country of ours the dandy fled chapter v preparations the journals of the day which said that that nearly impregnable structure of the barricade of the rue de la chanvrerie as they call it reached to the level of the first floor were mistaken the fact is that it did not exceed an average height of six or seven feet it was built in such a manner that the combatants could at their will either disappear behind it or dominate the barrier and even scale its crest by means of a quadruple row of paving stones placed on top of each other and arranged as steps in the interior on the outside the front of the barricade composed of piles of paving stones and casks bound together by beams and planks which were entangled in the wheels of anceau s dray and of the overturned omnibus had a bristling and inextricable aspect an aperture large enough to allow a man to pass through had been made between the wall of the houses and the extremity of the barricade which was furthest from the wine shop so that an exit was possible at this point the pole of the omnibus was placed upright and held up with ropes and a red flag fastened to this pole floated over the barricade the little mondétour barricade hidden behind the wine shop building was not visible the two barricades united formed a veritable redoubt enjolras and courfeyrac had not thought fit to barricade the other fragment of the rue mondétour which opens through the rue des prêcheurs an issue into the halles wishing no doubt to preserve a possible communication with the outside and not entertaining much fear of an attack through the dangerous and difficult street of the rue des prêcheurs with the exception of this issue which was left free and which constituted what folard in his strategical style would have termed a branch and taking into account also the narrow cutting arranged on the rue de la chanvrerie the interior of the barricade where the wine shop formed a salient angle presented an irregular square closed on all sides there existed an interval of twenty paces between the grand barrier and the lofty houses which formed the background of the street so that one might say that the barricade rested on these houses all inhabited but closed from top to bottom all this work was performed without any hindrance in less than an hour and without this handful of bold men seeing a single bear skin cap or a single bayonet make their appearance the very bourgeois who still ventured at this hour of riot to enter the rue saint denis cast a glance at the rue de la chanvrerie caught sight of the barricade and redoubled their pace the two barricades being finished and the flag run up a table was dragged out of the wine shop and courfeyrac mounted on the table enjolras brought the square coffer and courfeyrac opened it this coffer was filled with cartridges when the mob saw the cartridges a tremor ran through the bravest and a momentary silence ensued courfeyrac distributed them with a smile each one received thirty cartridges many had powder and set about making others with the bullets which they had run as for the barrel of powder it stood on a table on one side near the door and was held in reserve the alarm beat which ran through all paris did not cease but it had finally come to be nothing more than a monotonous noise to which they no longer paid any attention this noise retreated at times and again drew near with melancholy undulations they loaded the guns and carbines all together without haste with solemn gravity enjolras went and stationed three sentinels outside the barricades one in the rue de la chanvrerie the second in the rue des prêcheurs the third at the corner of the rue de la petite truanderie then the barricades having been built the posts assigned the guns loaded the sentinels stationed they waited alone in those redoubtable streets through which no one passed any longer surrounded by those dumb houses which seemed dead and in which no human movement palpitated enveloped in the deepening shades of twilight which was drawing on in the midst of that silence through which something could be felt advancing and which had about it something tragic and terrifying isolated armed determined and tranquil chapter vi waiting during those hours of waiting what did they do we must needs tell since this is a matter of history while the men made bullets and the women lint while a large saucepan of melted brass and lead destined to the bullet mould smoked over a glowing brazier while the sentinels watched weapon in hand on the barricade while enjolras whom it was impossible to divert kept an eye on the sentinels combeferre courfeyrac jean prouvaire feuilly bossuet joly bahorel and some others sought each other out and united as in the most peaceful days of their conversations in their student life and in one corner of this wine shop which had been converted into a casement a couple of paces distant from the redoubt which they had built with their carbines loaded and primed resting against the backs of their chairs these fine young fellows so close to a supreme hour began to recite

se sont envolés dans les cieux profonds a href linknote 53 name linknoteref 53 id linknoteref 53 53 a the hour the spot these souvenirs of youth recalled a few stars which began to twinkle in the sky the funeral repose of those deserted streets the imminence of the inexorable adventure which was in preparation gave a pathetic charm to these verses murmured in a low tone in the dusk by jean prouvaire who as we have said was a gentle poet in the meantime a lamp had been lighted in the small barricade and in the large one one of those wax torches such as are to be met with on shrove tuesday in front of vehicles loaded with masks on their way to la courtille these torches as the reader has seen came from the faubourg saint antoine the torch had been placed in a sort of cage of paving stones closed on three sides to shelter it from the wind and disposed in such a fashion that all the light fell on the flag the street and the barricade remained sunk in gloom and nothing was to be seen except the red flag formidably illuminated as by an enormous dark lantern this light enhanced the scarlet of the flag with an indescribable and terrible purple chapter vii the man recruited in the rue des billettes night was fully come nothing made its appearance all that they heard was confused noises and at intervals fusillades but these were rare badly sustained and distant this respite which was thus prolonged was a sign that the government was taking its time and collecting its forces these fifty men were waiting for sixty thousand enjolras felt attacked by that impatience which seizes on strong souls on the threshold of redoubtable events he went in search of gavroche who had set to making cartridges in the tap room by the dubious light of two candles placed on the counter by way of precaution on account of the powder which was scattered on the tables these two candles cast no gleam outside the insurgents had moreover taken pains not to have any light in the upper stories gavroche was deeply preoccupied at that moment but not precisely with his cartridges the man of the rue des billettes had just entered the tap room and had seated himself at the table which was the least lighted a musket of large model had fallen to his share and he held it between his legs gavroche who had been up to that moment distracted by a hundred amusing things had not even seen this man when he entered gavroche followed him mechanically with his eyes admiring his gun then all at once when the man was seated the street urchin sprang to his feet any one who had spied upon that man up to that moment would have seen that he was observing everything in the barricade and in the band of insurgents with singular attention but from the moment when he had entered this room he had fallen into a sort of brown study and no longer seemed to see anything that was going on the gamin approached this pensive personage and began to step around him on tiptoe as one walks in the vicinity of a person whom one is afraid of waking at the same time over his childish countenance which was at once so impudent and so serious so giddy and so profound so gay and so heart breaking passed all those grimaces of an old man which signify ah bah impossible my sight is bad i am dreaming can this be no it is not but yes why no etc gavroche balanced on his heels clenched both fists in his pockets moved his neck around like a bird expended in a gigantic pout all the sagacity of his lower lip he was astounded uncertain incredulous convinced dazzled he had the mien of the chief of the eunuchs in the slave mart discovering a venus among the blowsy females and the air of an amateur recognizing a raphael in a heap of daubs his whole being was at work the instinct which scents out and the intelligence which combines it was evident that a great event had happened in gavroche s life it was at the most intense point of this preoccupation that enjolras accosted him you are small said enjolras you will not be seen go out of the barricade slip along close to the houses skirmish about a bit in the streets and come back and tell me what is going on gavroche raised himself on his haunches so the little chaps are good for something that s very lucky i ll go in the meanwhile trust to the little fellows and distrust the big ones and gavroche raising his head and lowering his voice added as he indicated the man of the rue des billettes do you see that big fellow there well he s a police spy are you sure of it it isn t two weeks since he pulled me off the cornice of the port royal where i was taking the air by my ear enjolras hastily quitted the urchin and murmured a few words in a very low tone to a longshoreman from the winedocks who chanced to be at hand the man left the room and returned almost immediately accompanied by three others the four men four porters with broad shoulders went and placed themselves without doing anything to attract his attention behind the table on which the man of the rue des billettes was leaning with his elbows they were evidently ready to hurl themselves upon him then enjolras approached the man and demanded of him who are you at this abrupt query the man started he plunged his gaze deep into enjolras clear eyes and appeared to grasp the latter s meaning he smiled with a smile than which nothing more disdainful more energetic and more resolute could be seen in the world and replied with haughty gravity i see what it is well yes you are a police spy i am an agent of the authorities and your name javert enjolras made a sign to the four men in the twinkling of an eye before javert had time to turn round he was collared thrown down pinioned and searched they found on him a little round card pasted between two pieces of glass and bearing on one side the arms of france engraved and with this motto supervision and vigilance and on the other this note javert inspector of police aged fifty two and the signature of the prefect of police of that day m gisquet besides this he had his watch and his purse which contained several gold pieces they left him his purse and his watch under the watch at the bottom of his fob they felt and seized a paper in an envelope which enjolras unfolded and on which he read these five lines written in the very hand of the prefect of police as soon as his political mission is accomplished inspector javert will make sure by special supervision whether it is true that the malefactors have instituted intrigues on the right bank of the seine near the jena bridge the search ended they lifted javert to his feet bound his arms behind his back and fastened him to that celebrated post in the middle of the room which had formerly given the wine shop its name gavroche who had looked on at the whole of this scene and had approved of everything with a silent toss of his head stepped up to javert and said to him it s the mouse who has caught the cat all this was so rapidly executed that it was all over when those about the wine shop noticed it javert had not uttered a single cry at the sight of javert bound to the post courfeyrac bossuet joly combeferre and the men scattered over the two barricades came running up javert with his back to the post and so surrounded with ropes that he could not make a movement raised his head with the intrepid serenity of the man who has never lied he is a police spy said enjolras and turning to javert you will be shot ten minutes before the barricade is taken javert replied in his most imperious tone why not at once we are saving our powder then finish the business with a blow from a knife spy said the handsome enjolras we are judges and not assassins then he called gavroche here you go about your business do what i told you i m going cried gavroche and halting as he was on the point of setting out by the way you will give me his gun and he added i leave you the musician but i want the clarionet the gamin made the military salute and passed gayly through the opening in the large barricade chapter viii many interrogation points with regard to a certain le cabuc whose name may not have been le cabuc the tragic picture which we have undertaken would not be complete the reader would not see those grand moments of social birth pangs in a revolutionary birth which contain convulsion mingled with effort in their exact and real relief were we to omit in the sketch here outlined an incident full of epic and savage horror which occurred almost immediately after gavroche s departure mobs as the reader knows are like a snowball and collect as they roll along a throng of tumultuous men these men do not ask each other whence they come among the passers by who had joined the rabble led by enjolras combeferre and courfeyrac there had been a person wearing the jacket of a street porter which was very threadbare on the shoulders who gesticulated and vociferated and who had the look of a drunken savage this man whose name or nickname was le cabuc and who was moreover an utter stranger to those who pretended to know him was very drunk or assumed the appearance of being so and had seated himself with several others at a table which they had dragged outside of the wine shop this cabuc while making those who vied with him drunk seemed to be examining with a thoughtful air the large house at the extremity of the barricade whose five stories commanded the whole street and faced the rue saint denis all at once he exclaimed do you know comrades it is from that house yonder that we must fire when we are at the windows the deuce is in it if any one can advance into the street yes but the house is closed said one of the drinkers let us knock they will not open let us break in the door le cabuc runs to the door which had a very massive knocker and knocks the door opens not he strikes a second blow no one answers a third stroke the same silence is there any one here shouts cabuc nothing stirs then he seizes a gun and begins to batter the door with the butt end it was an ancient alley door low vaulted narrow solid entirely of oak lined on the inside with a sheet of iron and iron stays a genuine prison postern the blows from the butt end of the gun made the house tremble but did not shake the door nevertheless it is probable that the inhabitants were disturbed for a tiny square window was finally seen to open on the third story and at this aperture appeared the reverend and terrified face of a gray haired old man who was the porter and who held a candle the man who was knocking paused gentlemen said the porter what do you want open said cabuc that cannot be gentlemen open nevertheless impossible gentlemen le cabuc took his gun and aimed at the porter but as he was below and as it was very dark the porter did not see him will you open yes or no no gentlemen do you say no i say no my goo the porter did not finish the shot was fired the ball entered under his chin and came out at the nape of his neck after traversing the jugular vein the old man fell back without a sigh the candle fell and was extinguished and nothing more was to be seen except a motionless head lying on the sill of the small window and a little whitish smoke which floated off towards the roof there said le cabuc dropping the butt end of his gun to the pavement he had hardly uttered this word when he felt a hand laid on his shoulder with the weight of an eagle s talon and he heard a voice saying to him on your knees the murderer turned round and saw before him enjolras cold white face enjolras held a pistol in his hand he had hastened up at the sound of the discharge he had seized cabuc s collar blouse shirt and suspender with his left hand on your knees he repeated and with an imperious motion the frail young man of twenty years bent the thickset and sturdy porter like a reed and brought him to his knees in the mire le cabuc attempted to resist but he seemed to have been seized by a superhuman hand enjolras pale with bare neck and dishevelled hair and his woman s face had about him at that moment something of the antique themis his dilated nostrils his downcast eyes gave to his implacable greek profile that expression of wrath and that expression of chastity which as the ancient world viewed the matter befit justice the whole barricade hastened up then all ranged themselves in a circle at a distance feeling that it was impossible to utter a word in the presence of the thing which they were about to behold le cabuc vanquished no longer tried to struggle and trembled in every limb enjolras released him and drew out his watch collect yourself said he think or pray you have one minute mercy murmured the murderer then he dropped his head and stammered a few inarticulate oaths enjolras never took his eyes off of him he allowed a minute to pass then he replaced his watch in his fob that done he grasped le cabuc by the hair as the latter coiled himself into a ball at his knees and shrieked and placed the muzzle of the pistol to his ear many of those intrepid men who had so tranquilly entered upon the most terrible of adventures turned aside their heads an explosion was heard the assassin fell to the pavement face downwards enjolras straightened himself up and cast a convinced and severe glance around him then he spurned the corpse with his foot and said throw that outside three men raised the body of the unhappy wretch which was still agitated by the last mechanical convulsions of the life that had fled and flung it over the little barricade into the rue mondétour enjolras was thoughtful it is impossible to say what grandiose shadows slowly spread over his redoubtable serenity all at once he raised his voice a silence fell upon them citizens said enjolras what that man did is frightful what i have done is horrible he killed therefore i killed him i had to do it because insurrection must have its discipline assassination is even more of a crime here than elsewhere we are under the eyes of the revolution we are the priests of the republic we are the victims of duty and must not be possible to slander our combat i have therefore tried that man and condemned him to death as for myself constrained as i am to do what i have done and yet abhorring it i have judged myself also and you shall soon see to what i have condemned myself those who listened to him shuddered we will share thy fate cried combeferre so be it replied enjolras one word more in executing this man i have obeyed necessity but necessity is a monster of the old world necessity s name is fatality now the law of progress is that monsters shall disappear before the angels and that fatality shall vanish before fraternity it is a bad moment to pronounce the word love no matter i do pronounce it and i glorify it love the future is thine death i make use of thee but i hate thee citizens in the future there will be neither darkness nor thunderbolts neither ferocious ignorance nor bloody retaliation as there will be no more satan there will be no more michael in the future no one will kill any one else the earth will beam with radiance the human race will love the day will come citizens when all will be concord harmony light joy and life it will come and it is in order that it may come that we are about to die enjolras ceased his virgin lips closed and he remained for some time standing on the spot where he had shed blood in marble immobility his staring eye caused those about him to speak in low tones jean prouvaire and combeferre pressed each other s hands silently and leaning against each other in an angle of the barricade they watched with an admiration in which there was some compassion that grave young man executioner and priest composed of light like crystal and also of rock let us say at once that later on after the action when the bodies were taken to the morgue and searched a police agent s card was found on le cabuc the author of this book had in his hands in 1848 the special report on this subject made to the prefect of police in 1832 we will add that if we are to believe a tradition of the police which is strange but probably well founded le cabuc was claquesous the fact is that dating from the death of le cabuc there was no longer any question of claquesous claquesous had nowhere left any trace of his disappearance he would seem to have amalgamated himself with the invisible his life had been all shadows his end was night the whole insurgent group was still under the influence of the emotion of that tragic case which had been so quickly tried and so quickly terminated when courfeyrac again beheld on the barricade the small young man who had inquired of him that morning for marius this lad who had a bold and reckless air had come by night to join the insurgents book thirteenth marius enters the shadow chapter i from the rue plumet to the quartier saint denis the voice which had summoned marius through the twilight to the barricade of the rue de la chanvrerie had produced on him the effect of the voice of destiny he wished to die the opportunity presented itself he knocked at the door of the tomb a hand in the darkness offered him the key these melancholy openings which take place in the gloom before despair are tempting marius thrust aside the bar which had so often allowed him to pass emerged from the garden and said i will go mad with grief no longer conscious of anything fixed or solid in his brain incapable of accepting anything thenceforth of fate after those two months passed in the intoxication of youth and love overwhelmed at once by all the reveries of despair he had but one desire remaining to make a speedy end of all he set out at rapid pace he found himself most opportunely armed as he had javert s pistols with him the young man of whom he thought that he had caught a glimpse had vanished from his sight in the street marius who had emerged from the rue plumet by the boulevard traversed the esplanade and the bridge of the invalides the champs élysées the place louis xv and reached the rue de rivoli the shops were open there the gas was burning under the arcades women were making their purchases in the stalls people were eating ices in the café laiter and nibbling small cakes at the english pastry cook s shop only a few posting chaises were setting out at a gallop from the hôtel des princes and the hôtel meurice marius entered the rue saint honoré through the passage delorme there the shops were closed the merchants were chatting in front of their half open doors people were walking about the street lanterns were lighted beginning with the first floor all the windows were lighted as usual there was cavalry on the place du palais royal marius followed the rue saint honoré in proportion as he left the palais royal behind him there were fewer lighted windows the shops were fast shut no one was chatting on the thresholds the street grew sombre and at the same time the crowd increased in density for the passers by now amounted to a crowd no one could be seen to speak in this throng and yet there arose from it a dull deep murmur near the fountain of the arbre sec there were assemblages motionless and gloomy groups which were to those who went and came as stones in the midst of running water at the entrance to the rue des prouvaires the crowd no longer walked it formed a resisting massive solid compact almost impenetrable block of people who were huddled together and conversing in low tones there were hardly any black coats or round hats now but smock frocks blouses caps and bristling and cadaverous heads this multitude undulated confusedly in the nocturnal gloom its whisperings had the hoarse accent of a vibration although not one of them was walking a dull trampling was audible in the mire beyond this dense portion of the throng in the rue du roule in the rue des prouvaires and in the extension of the rue saint honoré there was no longer a single window in which a candle was burning only the solitary and diminishing rows of lanterns could be seen vanishing into the street in the distance the lanterns of that date resembled large red stars hanging to ropes and shed upon the pavement a shadow which had the form of a huge spider these streets were not deserted there could be descried piles of guns moving bayonets and troops bivouacking no curious observer passed that limit there circulation ceased there the rabble ended and the army began marius willed with the will of a man who hopes no more he had been summoned he must go he found a means to traverse the throng and to pass the bivouac of the troops he shunned the patrols he avoided the sentinels he made a circuit reached the rue de béthisy and directed his course towards the halles at the corner of the rue des bourdonnais there were no longer any lanterns after having passed the zone of the crowd he had passed the limits of the troops he found himself in something startling there was no longer a passer by no longer a soldier no longer a light there was no one solitude silence night i know not what chill which seized hold upon one entering a street was like entering a cellar he continued to advance he took a few steps some one passed close to him at a run was it a man or a woman were there many of them he could not have told it had passed and vanished proceeding from circuit to circuit he reached a lane which he judged to be the rue de la poterie near the middle of this street he came in contact with an obstacle he extended his hands it was an overturned wagon his foot recognized pools of water gullies and paving stones scattered and piled up a barricade had been begun there and abandoned he climbed over the stones and found himself on the other side of the barrier he walked very near the street posts and guided himself along the walls of the houses a little beyond the barricade it seemed to him that he could make out something white in front of him he approached it took on a form it was two white horses the horses of the omnibus harnessed by bossuet in the morning who had been straying at random all day from street to street and had finally halted there with the weary patience of brutes who no more understand the actions of men than man understands the actions of providence marius left the horses behind him as he was approaching a street which seemed to him to be the rue du contrat social a shot coming no one knows whence and traversing the darkness at random whistled close by him and the bullet pierced a brass shaving dish suspended above his head over a hairdresser s shop this pierced shaving dish was still to be seen in 1848 in the rue du contrat social at the corner of the pillars of the market this shot still betokened life from that instant forth he encountered nothing more the whole of this itinerary resembled a descent of black steps nevertheless marius pressed forward chapter ii an owl s view of paris a being who could have hovered over paris that night with the wing of the bat or the owl would have had beneath his eyes a gloomy spectacle all that old quarter of the halles which is like a city within a city through which run the rues saint denis and saint martin where a thousand lanes cross and of which the insurgents had made their redoubt and their stronghold would have appeared to him like a dark and enormous cavity hollowed out in the centre of paris there the glance fell into an abyss thanks to the broken lanterns thanks to the closed windows there all radiance all life all sound all movement ceased the invisible police of the insurrection were on the watch everywhere and maintained order that is to say night the necessary tactics of insurrection are to drown small numbers in a vast obscurity to multiply every combatant by the possibilities which that obscurity contains at dusk every window where a candle was burning received a shot the light was extinguished sometimes the inhabitant was killed hence nothing was stirring there was nothing but fright mourning stupor in the houses and in the streets a sort of sacred horror not even the long rows of windows and stores the indentations of the chimneys and the roofs and the vague reflections which are cast back by the wet and muddy pavements were visible an eye cast upward at that mass of shadows might perhaps have caught a glimpse here and there at intervals of indistinct gleams which brought out broken and eccentric lines and profiles of singular buildings something like the lights which go and come in ruins it was at such points that the barricades were situated the rest was a lake of obscurity foggy heavy and funereal above which in motionless and melancholy outlines rose the tower of saint jacques the church of saint merry and two or three more of those grand edifices of which man makes giants and the night makes phantoms all around this deserted and disquieting labyrinth in the quarters where the parisian circulation had not been annihilated and where a few street lanterns still burned the aerial observer might have distinguished the metallic gleam of swords and bayonets the dull rumble of artillery and the swarming of silent battalions whose ranks were swelling from minute to minute a formidable girdle which was slowly drawing in and around the insurrection the invested quarter was no longer anything more than a monstrous cavern everything there appeared to be asleep or motionless and as we have just seen any street which one might come to offered nothing but darkness a wild darkness full of traps full of unseen and formidable shocks into which it was alarming to penetrate and in which it was terrible to remain where those who entered shivered before those whom they awaited where those who waited shuddered before those who were coming invisible combatants were entrenched at every corner of the street snares of the sepulchre concealed in the density of night all was over no more light was to be hoped for henceforth except the lightning of guns no further encounter except the abrupt and rapid apparition of death where how when no one knew but it was certain and inevitable in this place which had been marked out for the struggle the government and the insurrection the national guard and popular societies the bourgeois and the uprising groping their way were about to come into contact the necessity was the same for both the only possible issue thenceforth was to emerge thence killed or conquerors a situation so extreme an obscurity so powerful that the most timid felt themselves seized with resolution and the most daring with terror moreover on both sides the fury the rage and the determination were equal for the one party to advance meant death and no one dreamed of retreating for the other to remain meant death and no one dreamed of flight it was indispensable that all should be ended on the following day that triumph should rest either here or there that the insurrection should prove itself a revolution or a skirmish the government understood this as well as the parties the most insignificant bourgeois felt it hence a thought of anguish which mingled with the impenetrable gloom of this quarter where all was at the point of being decided hence a redoubled anxiety around that silence whence a catastrophe was on the point of emerging here only one sound was audible a sound as heart rending as the death rattle as menacing as a malediction the tocsin of saint merry nothing could be more blood curdling than the clamor of that wild and desperate bell wailing amid the shadows as it often happens nature seemed to have fallen into accord with what men were about to do nothing disturbed the harmony of the whole effect the stars had disappeared heavy clouds filled the horizon with their melancholy folds a black sky rested on these dead streets as though an immense winding sheet were being outspread over this immense tomb while a battle that was still wholly political was in preparation in the same locality which had already witnessed so many revolutionary events while youth the secret associations the schools in the name of principles and the middle classes in the name of interests were approaching preparatory to dashing themselves together clasping and throwing each other while each one hastened and invited the last and decisive hour of the crisis far away and quite outside of this fatal quarter in the most profound depths of the unfathomable cavities of that wretched old paris which disappears under the splendor of happy and opulent paris the sombre voice of the people could be heard giving utterance to a dull roar a fearful and sacred voice which is composed of the roar of the brute and of the word of god which terrifies the weak and which warns the wise which comes both from below like the voice of the lion and from on high like the voice of the thunder chapter iii the extreme edge marius had reached the halles there everything was still calmer more obscure and more motionless than in the neighboring streets one would have said that the glacial peace of the sepulchre had sprung forth from the earth and had spread over the heavens nevertheless a red glow brought out against this black background the lofty roofs of the houses which barred the rue de la chanvrerie on the saint eustache side it was the reflection of the torch which was burning in the corinthe barricade marius directed his steps towards that red light it had drawn him to the marché aux poirées and he caught a glimpse of the dark mouth of the rue des prêcheurs he entered it the insurgents sentinel who was guarding the other end did not see him he felt that he was very close to that which he had come in search of and he walked on tiptoe in this manner he reached the elbow of that short section of the rue mondétour which was as the reader will remember the only communication which enjolras had preserved with the outside world at the corner of the last house on his left he thrust his head forward and looked into the fragment of the rue mondétour a little beyond the angle of the lane and the rue de la chanvrerie which cast a broad curtain of shadow in which he was himself engulfed he perceived some light on the pavement a bit of the wine shop and beyond a flickering lamp within a sort of shapeless wall and men crouching down with guns on their knees all this was ten fathoms distant from him it was the interior of the barricade the houses which bordered the lane on the right concealed the rest of the wine shop the large barricade and the flag from him marius had but a step more to take then the unhappy young man seated himself on a post folded his arms and fell to thinking about his father he thought of that heroic colonel pontmercy who had been so proud a soldier who had guarded the frontier of france under the republic and had touched the frontier of asia under napoleon who had beheld genoa alexandria milan turin madrid vienna dresden berlin moscow who had left on all the victorious battle fields of europe drops of that same blood which he marius had in his veins who had grown gray before his time in discipline and command who had lived with his sword belt buckled his epaulets falling on his breast his cockade blackened with powder his brow furrowed with his helmet in barracks in camp in the bivouac in ambulances and who at the expiration of twenty years had returned from the great wars with a scarred cheek a smiling countenance tranquil admirable pure as a child having done everything for france and nothing against her he said to himself that his day had also come now that his hour had struck that following his father he too was about to show himself brave intrepid bold to run to meet the bullets to offer his breast to bayonets to shed his blood to seek the enemy to seek death that he was about to wage war in his turn and descend to the field of battle and that the field of battle upon which he was to descend was the street and that the war in which he was about to engage was civil war he beheld civil war laid open like a gulf before him and into this he was about to fall then he shuddered he thought of his father s sword which his grandfather had sold to a second hand dealer and which he had so mournfully regretted he said to himself that that chaste and valiant sword had done well to escape from him and to depart in wrath into the gloom that if it had thus fled it was because it was intelligent and because it had foreseen the future that it had had a presentiment of this rebellion the war of the gutters the war of the pavements fusillades through cellar windows blows given and received in the rear it was because coming from marengo and friedland it did not wish to go to the rue de la chanvrerie it was because after what it had done with the father it did not wish to do this for the son he told himself that if that sword were there if after taking possession of it at his father s pillow he had dared to take it and carry it off for this combat of darkness between frenchmen in the streets it would assuredly have scorched his hands and burst out aflame before his eyes like the sword of the angel he told himself that it was fortunate that it was not there and that it had disappeared that that was well that that was just that his grandfather had been the true guardian of his father s glory and that it was far better that the colonel s sword should be sold at auction sold to the old clothes man thrown among the old junk than that it should to day wound the side of his country and then he fell to weeping bitterly this was horrible but what was he to do live without cosette he could not since she was gone he must needs die had he not given her his word of honor that he would die she had gone knowing that this meant that it pleased her that marius should die and then it was clear that she no longer loved him since she had departed thus without warning without a word without a letter although she knew his address what was the good of living and why should he live now and then what should he retreat after going so far should he flee from danger after having approached it should he slip away after having come and peeped into the barricade slip away all in a tremble saying after all i have had enough of it as it is i have seen it that suffices this is civil war and i shall take my leave should he abandon his friends who were expecting him who were in need of him possibly who were a mere handful against an army should he be untrue at once to his love to country to his word should he give to his cowardice the pretext of patriotism but this was impossible and if the phantom of his father was there in the gloom and beheld him retreating he would beat him on the loins with the flat of his sword and shout to him march on you poltroon thus a prey to the conflicting movements of his thoughts he dropped his head all at once he raised it a sort of splendid rectification had just been effected in his mind there is a widening of the sphere of thought which is peculiar to the vicinity of the grave it makes one see clearly to be near death the vision of the action into which he felt that he was perhaps on the point of entering appeared to him no more as lamentable but as superb the war of the street was suddenly transfigured by some unfathomable inward working of his soul before the eye of his thought all the tumultuous interrogation points of revery recurred to him in throngs but without troubling him he left none of them unanswered let us see why should his father be indignant are there not cases where insurrection rises to the dignity of duty what was there that was degrading for the son of colonel pontmercy in the combat which was about to begin it is no longer montmirail nor champaubert it is something quite different the question is no longer one of sacred territory but of a holy idea the country wails that may be but humanity applauds but is it true that the country does wail france bleeds but liberty smiles and in the presence of liberty s smile france forgets her wound and then if we look at things from a still more lofty point of view why do we speak of civil war civil war what does that mean is there a foreign war is not all war between men war between brothers war is qualified only by its object there is no such thing as foreign or civil war there is only just and unjust war until that day when the grand human agreement is concluded war that at least which is the effort of the future which is hastening on against the past which is lagging in the rear may be necessary what have we to reproach that war with war does not become a disgrace the sword does not become a disgrace except when it is used for assassinating the right progress reason civilization truth then war whether foreign or civil is iniquitous it is called crime outside the pale of that holy thing justice by what right does one form of man despise another by what right should the sword of washington disown the pike of camille desmoulins leonidas against the stranger timoleon against the tyrant which is the greater the one is the defender the other the liberator shall we brand every appeal to arms within a city s limits without taking the object into a consideration then note the infamy of brutus marcel arnould von blankenheim coligny hedgerow war war of the streets why not that was the war of ambiorix of artevelde of marnix of pelagius but ambiorix fought against rome artevelde against france marnix against spain pelagius against the moors all against the foreigner well the monarchy is a foreigner oppression is a stranger the right divine is a stranger despotism violates the moral frontier an invasion violates the geographical frontier driving out the tyrant or driving out the english in both cases regaining possession of one s own territory there comes an hour when protestation no longer suffices after philosophy action is required live force finishes what the idea has sketched out prometheus chained begins arostogeiton ends the encyclopedia enlightens souls the 10th of august electrifies them after æschylus thrasybulus after diderot danton multitudes have a tendency to accept the master their mass bears witness to apathy a crowd is easily led as a whole to obedience men must be stirred up pushed on treated roughly by the very benefit of their deliverance their eyes must be wounded by the true light must be hurled at them in terrible handfuls they must be a little thunderstruck themselves at their own well being this dazzling awakens them hence the necessity of tocsins and wars great combatants must rise must enlighten nations with audacity and shake up that sad humanity which is covered with gloom by the right divine cæsarian glory force fanaticism irresponsible power and absolute majesty a rabble stupidly occupied in the contemplation in their twilight splendor of these sombre triumphs of the night down with the tyrant of whom are you speaking do you call louis philippe the tyrant no no more than louis xvi both of them are what history is in the habit of calling good kings but principles are not to be parcelled out the logic of the true is rectilinear the peculiarity of truth is that it lacks complaisance no concessions then all encroachments on man should be repressed there is a divine right in louis xvi there is because a bourbon in louis philippe both represent in a certain measure the confiscation of right and in order to clear away universal insurrection they must be combated it must be done france being always the one to begin when the master falls in france he falls everywhere in short what cause is more just and consequently what war is greater than that which re establishes social truth restores her throne to liberty restores the people to the people restores sovereignty to man replaces the purple on the head of france restores equity and reason in their plenitude suppresses every germ of antagonism by restoring each one to himself annihilates the obstacle which royalty presents to the whole immense universal concord and places the human race once more on a level with the right these wars build up peace an enormous fortress of prejudices privileges superstitions lies exactions abuses violences iniquities and darkness still stands erect in this world with its towers of hatred it must be cast down this monstrous mass must be made to crumble to conquer at austerlitz is grand to take the bastille is immense there is no one who has not noticed it in his own case the soul and therein lies the marvel of its unity complicated with ubiquity has a strange aptitude for reasoning almost coldly in the most violent extremities and it often happens that heartbroken passion and profound despair in the very agony of their blackest monologues treat subjects and discuss theses logic is mingled with convulsion and the thread of the syllogism floats without breaking in the mournful storm of thought this was the situation of marius mind as he meditated thus dejected but resolute hesitating in every direction and in short shuddering at what he was about to do his glance strayed to the interior of the barricade the insurgents were here conversing in a low voice without moving and there was perceptible that quasi silence which marks the last stage of expectation overhead at the small window in the third story marius descried a sort of spectator who appeared to him to be singularly attentive this was the porter who had been killed by le cabuc below by the lights of the torch which was thrust between the paving stones this head could be vaguely distinguished nothing could be stranger in that sombre and uncertain gleam than that livid motionless astonished face with its bristling hair its eyes fixed and staring and its yawning mouth bent over the street in an attitude of curiosity one would have said that the man who was dead was surveying those who were about to die a long trail of blood which had flowed from that head descended in reddish threads from the window to the height of the first floor where it stopped book fourteenth the grandeurs of despair enlarge chapter i the flag act first as yet nothing had come ten o clock had sounded from saint merry enjolras and combeferre had gone and seated themselves carbines in hand near the outlet of the grand barricade they no longer addressed each other they listened seeking to catch even the faintest and most distant sound of marching suddenly in the midst of the dismal calm a clear gay young voice which seemed to come from the rue saint denis rose and began to sing distinctly to the old popular air of by the light of the moon this bit of poetry terminated by a cry like the crow of a cock mon nez est en larmes mon ami bugeaud prête moi tes gendarmes pour leur dire un mot en capote bleue la poule au shako voici la banlieue co cocorico a href linknote 54 name linknoteref 54 id linknoteref 54 54 a they pressed each other s hands that is gavroche said enjolras he is warning us said combeferre a hasty rush troubled the deserted street they beheld a being more agile than a clown climb over the omnibus and gavroche bounded into the barricade all breathless saying my gun here they are an electric quiver shot through the whole barricade and the sound of hands seeking their guns became audible would you like my carbine said enjolras to the lad i want a big gun replied gavroche and he seized javert s gun two sentinels had fallen back and had come in almost at the same moment as gavroche they were the sentinels from the end of the street and the vidette of the rue de la petite truanderie the vidette of the lane des prêcheurs had remained at his post which indicated that nothing was approaching from the direction of the bridges and halles the rue de la chanvrerie of which a few paving stones alone were dimly visible in the reflection of the light projected on the flag offered to the insurgents the aspect of a vast black door vaguely opened into a smoke each man had taken up his position for the conflict forty three insurgents among whom were enjolras combeferre courfeyrac bossuet joly bahorel and gavroche were kneeling inside the large barricade with their heads on a level with the crest of the barrier the barrels of their guns and carbines aimed on the stones as though at loop holes attentive mute ready to fire six commanded by feuilly had installed themselves with their guns levelled at their shoulders at the windows of the two stories of corinthe several minutes passed thus then a sound of footsteps measured heavy and numerous became distinctly audible in the direction of saint leu this sound faint at first then precise then heavy and sonorous approached slowly without halt without intermission with a tranquil and terrible continuity nothing was to be heard but this it was that combined silence and sound of the statue of the commander but this stony step had something indescribably enormous and multiple about it which awakened the idea of a throng and at the same time the idea of a spectre one thought one heard the terrible statue legion marching onward this tread drew near it drew still nearer and stopped it seemed as though the breathing of many men could be heard at the end of the street nothing was to be seen however but at the bottom of that dense obscurity there could be distinguished a multitude of metallic threads as fine as needles and almost imperceptible which moved about like those indescribable phosphoric networks which one sees beneath one s closed eyelids in the first mists of slumber at the moment when one is dropping off to sleep these were bayonets and gun barrels confusedly illuminated by the distant reflection of the torch a pause ensued as though both sides were waiting all at once from the depths of this darkness a voice which was all the more sinister since no one was visible and which appeared to be the gloom itself speaking shouted who goes there at the same time the click of guns as they were lowered into position was heard enjolras replied in a haughty and vibrating tone the french revolution fire shouted the voice a flash empurpled all the façades in the street as though the door of a furnace had been flung open and hastily closed again a fearful detonation burst forth on the barricade the red flag fell the discharge had been so violent and so dense that it had cut the staff that is to say the very tip of the omnibus pole bullets which had rebounded from the cornices of the houses penetrated the barricade and wounded several men the impression produced by this first discharge was freezing the attack had been rough and of a nature to inspire reflection in the boldest it was evident that they had to deal with an entire regiment at the very least comrades shouted courfeyrac let us not waste our powder let us wait until they are in the street before replying and above all said enjolras let us raise the flag again he picked up the flag which had fallen precisely at his feet outside the clatter of the ramrods in the guns could be heard the troops were re loading their arms enjolras went on who is there here with a bold heart who will plant the flag on the barricade again not a man responded to mount on the barricade at the very moment when without any doubt it was again the object of their aim was simply death the bravest hesitated to pronounce his own condemnation enjolras himself felt a thrill he repeated does no one volunteer chapter ii the flag act second since they had arrived at corinthe and had begun the construction of the barricade no attention had been paid to father mabeuf m mabeuf had not quitted the mob however he had entered the ground floor of the wine shop and had seated himself behind the counter there he had so to speak retreated into himself he no longer seemed to look or to think courfeyrac and others had accosted him two or three times warning him of his peril beseeching him to withdraw but he did not hear them when they were not speaking to him his mouth moved as though he were replying to some one and as soon as he was addressed his lips became motionless and his eyes no longer had the appearance of being alive several hours before the barricade was attacked he had assumed an attitude which he did not afterwards abandon with both fists planted on his knees and his head thrust forward as though he were gazing over a precipice nothing had been able to move him from this attitude it did not seem as though his mind were in the barricade when each had gone to take up his position for the combat there remained in the tap room where javert was bound to the post only a single insurgent with a naked sword watching over javert and himself mabeuf at the moment of the attack at the detonation the physical shock had reached him and had as it were awakened him he started up abruptly crossed the room and at the instant when enjolras repeated his appeal does no one volunteer the old man was seen to make his appearance on the threshold of the wine shop his presence produced a sort of commotion in the different groups a shout went up it is the voter it is the member of the convention it is the representative of the people it is probable that he did not hear them he strode straight up to enjolras the insurgents withdrawing before him with a religious fear he tore the flag from enjolras who recoiled in amazement and then since no one dared to stop or to assist him this old man of eighty with shaking head but firm foot began slowly to ascend the staircase of paving stones arranged in the barricade this was so melancholy and so grand that all around him cried off with your hats at every step that he mounted it was a frightful spectacle his white locks his decrepit face his lofty bald and wrinkled brow his amazed and open mouth his aged arm upholding the red banner rose through the gloom and were enlarged in the bloody light of the torch and the bystanders thought that they beheld the spectre of 93 emerging from the earth with the flag of terror in his hand when he had reached the last step when this trembling and terrible phantom erect on that pile of rubbish in the presence of twelve hundred invisible guns drew himself up in the face of death and as though he were more powerful than it the whole barricade assumed amid the darkness a supernatural and colossal form there ensued one of those silences which occur only in the presence of prodigies in the midst of this silence the old man waved the red flag and shouted long live the revolution long live the republic fraternity equality and death those in the barricade heard a low and rapid whisper like the murmur of a priest who is despatching a prayer in haste it was probably the commissary of police who was making the legal summons at the other end of the street then the same piercing voice which had shouted who goes there shouted retire m mabeuf pale haggard his eyes lighted up with the mournful flame of aberration raised the flag above his head and repeated long live the republic fire said the voice a second discharge similar to the first rained down upon the barricade the old man fell on his knees then rose again dropped the flag and fell backwards on the pavement like a log at full length with outstretched arms rivulets of blood flowed beneath him his aged head pale and sad seemed to be gazing at the sky one of those emotions which are superior to man which make him forget even to defend himself seized upon the insurgents and they approached the body with respectful awe what men these regicides were said enjolras courfeyrac bent down to enjolras ear this is for yourself alone i do not wish to dampen the enthusiasm but this man was anything rather than a regicide i knew him his name was father mabeuf i do not know what was the matter with him to day but he was a brave blockhead just look at his head the head of a blockhead and the heart of a brutus replied enjolras then he raised his voice citizens this is the example which the old give to the young we hesitated he came we were drawing back he advanced this is what those who are trembling with age teach to those who tremble with fear this aged man is august in the eyes of his country he has had a long life and a magnificent death now let us place the body under cover that each one of us may defend this old man dead as he would his father living and may his presence in our midst render the barricade impregnable a murmur of gloomy and energetic assent followed these words enjolras bent down raised the old man s head and fierce as he was he kissed him on the brow then throwing wide his arms and handling this dead man with tender precaution as though he feared to hurt it he removed his coat showed the bloody holes in it to all and said this is our flag now chapter iii gavroche would have done better to accept enjolras carbine they threw a long black shawl of widow hucheloup s over father mabeuf six men made a litter of their guns on this they laid the body and bore it with bared heads with solemn slowness to the large table in the tap room these men wholly absorbed in the grave and sacred task in which they were engaged thought no more of the perilous situation in which they stood when the corpse passed near javert who was still impassive enjolras said to the spy it will be your turn presently during all this time little gavroche who alone had not quitted his post but had remained on guard thought he espied some men stealthily approaching the barricade all at once he shouted look out courfeyrac enjolras jean prouvaire combeferre joly bahorel bossuet and all the rest ran tumultuously from the wine shop it was almost too late they saw a glistening density of bayonets undulating above the barricade municipal guards of lofty stature were making their way in some striding over the omnibus others through the cut thrusting before them the urchin who retreated but did not flee the moment was critical it was that first redoubtable moment of inundation when the stream rises to the level of the levee and when the water begins to filter through the fissures of dike a second more and the barricade would have been taken bahorel dashed upon the first municipal guard who was entering and killed him on the spot with a blow from his gun the second killed bahorel with a blow from his bayonet another had already overthrown courfeyrac who was shouting follow me the largest of all a sort of colossus marched on gavroche with his bayonet fixed the urchin took in his arms javert s immense gun levelled it resolutely at the giant and fired no discharge followed javert s gun was not loaded the municipal guard burst into a laugh and raised his bayonet at the child before the bayonet had touched gavroche the gun slipped from the soldier s grasp a bullet had struck the municipal guardsman in the centre of the forehead and he fell over on his back a second bullet struck the other guard who had assaulted courfeyrac in the breast and laid him low on the pavement this was the work of marius who had just entered the barricade chapter iv the barrel of powder marius still concealed in the turn of the rue mondétour had witnessed shuddering and irresolute the first phase of the combat but he had not long been able to resist that mysterious and sovereign vertigo which may be designated as the call of the abyss in the presence of the imminence of the peril in the presence of the death of m mabeuf that melancholy enigma in the presence of bahorel killed and courfeyrac shouting follow me of that child threatened of his friends to succor or to avenge all hesitation had vanished and he had flung himself into the conflict his two pistols in hand with his first shot he had saved gavroche and with the second delivered courfeyrac amid the sound of the shots amid the cries of the assaulted guards the assailants had climbed the entrenchment on whose summit municipal guards soldiers of the line and national guards from the suburbs could now be seen
